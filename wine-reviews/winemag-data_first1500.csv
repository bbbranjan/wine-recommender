7,Spain,"Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly.

21,France,This wine is in peak condition. The tannins and the secondary flavors dominate this ripe leather-textured wine. The fruit is all there as well: dried berries and hints of black-plum skins.

22,US,"With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral.

649,US,"This is an unusually buttery wine, as if it had been put through some special sort of malolactic fermentation. It feels manipulated, softened and buttered up, with the fruit subdued. Traces of herb remain, but they are like shadows on the wall. Perhaps the house style does not accommodate this particular vineyard's character. This wine makes it hard to know.",Prince Hill,86,45,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Erath

The mouth is surprisingly round but the finish is mouthwatering and clean.,,86,13,Stellenbosch,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Beau Joubert
654,US,"This dry Riesling has a steely spine running right through the heart of the wine; you can almost taste the metal. It defines and confines the flavors; the fruit seems like an afterthought. That said, it might just be the perfect wine to try with fresh oysters, firm and lightly lemony with a hint of brine.",,86,12,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Riesling,A to Z
655,Argentina,"Scratchy on the nose, with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate has a generic, rubbery feel and sweet, standard cherry, cassis and plum flavors.

661,US,"This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there.

665,US,"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",Memento,94,110,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frazier
666,US,"So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure.

675,US,"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine.

683,US,"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness.

1236,Argentina,"Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of, and the palate is dilute, tangy, citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.",Famiglia Bianchi,80,12,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Sauvignon Blanc,Valentin Bianchi

1240,Argentina,"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose.
