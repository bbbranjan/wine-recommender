7,Spain,"Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly.

21,France,This wine is in peak condition. The tannins and the secondary flavors dominate this ripe leather-textured wine. The fruit is all there as well: dried berries and hints of black-plum skins.

22,US,"With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral.

193,Spain,"Right away this goes wrong; the nose is smothered with charred, burning oak that smells harsh and like chemicals. A tannic, resiny palate is barely acceptable, as are bitter, burnt, resiny blackberry flavors.",Vendimia Seleccionada,80,17,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Sembro
194,Portugal,"This is a light, fruity and off-dry wine. It has splashes of lemon and sweet citrus, with a crisp finish.",,80,8,Vinho Verde,,,Portuguese White,Mapreco
195,Chile,"This smells forced and grapy, with murky undertones. Flabby on the palate, this organic red tastes nutty and earthy. An aftertaste of mulch and peanut is off base and highly questionable.",Organic,80,14,Maipo Valley,,,Carmen√®re,Teillery
196,US,"This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit.",,80,18,California,Bennett Valley,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Ektimo Vineyards
197,Chile,"This is fleshy and dilute up front, then heavy and globular in feel. Pickled melon and vegetal stone-fruit flavors finish weak.",,80,11,Central Valley,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Rai
198,Spain,"Feral, feline, sweaty aromas precede an awkward palate with bitter flavors of weedy berry, citrus fruits and pyrazines. A scallion-like quality drives the finish on this strange, bitter ros√©.",Rosa de Arrocal,80,15,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Ros√©,Arrocal
199,Chile,"Aromas of canned pear and peach are not fresh. This is syrupy in the mouth, with a bland mix of vanilla and melon flavors. Oxidized on the finish.",Reserva,80,12,Maule Valley,,,Chardonnay-Viognier,Oveja Negra
200,Chile,"Aromas of sweet corn and melon are not convincing. This has little in the way of mouthfeel or substance; flavors of candied fruits taste like corn and wheat, while the finish is spineless.",,80,15,Itata Valley,,,Chardonnay,M√§nnle
