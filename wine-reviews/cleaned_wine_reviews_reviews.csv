"Among the Napa Valley's most crowning achievements in Cabernet, this vintage of Hillside Select is stunning, bright and beguiling in every way. Intensely layered, its interwoven flavors burst in black licorice, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, gun smoke and garrigue. Spicy oak adds to the power and weight. Drinkable now, it will show even greater finesse in time; enjoy best 20232033 and possibly beyond."
"Intoxicating scents of smoke, flint, dried mountain herb and woodland berry are just some of the multifaceted aromas you'll find on this dazzling Nebbiolo.

Vibrant acidity gives it impeccable balance while a flinty mineral vein energizes the finish. Some may find this almost too ethereal while lovers of finesse, complexity and balance will be enchanted. Drink through 2027."

Now close to the top of the classification tree in Saint-milion, this vintage shows the impressive nature of this powerful wine. With a good balance between acidity and black fruits backed up by tannins, the wine is powerful and stylish. Drink from 2027."

"Direct and concentrated, this wine is powered by tannins and a firm texture. Dense, it has the potential for plenty of fruit as it matures. That will take time, because this impressive wine is powered by its structure. Wait until 2028."
"Always one of the great white wines of the world, this vintage continues that reputation. With its richness, density and layers of fruit and acidity, this wine is powerful and beautifully ripe. The wood aging is just a hint in background. Drink from 2024."
"It's always a clich to compare wine to the nectar of the gods but there's little that comes closer than this. It's decadently sweet, offering layer upon layer of unctuous honey and stone-fruit nectar, yet exhilarating, fine and filigreed. The finish is endless and breathtaking. Delicious now but will hold for decades to come."
"Starting with the 2008 vintage, the firm's flagship bottling is now made without added dosage. It opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, brioche and crushed stone that carry over to the elegantly structured palate, along with tangy tangerine and bright acidity. A refined perlage gives it a weightless concentration while a savory mineral note lingers on the bone-dry finish. In a word, it's gorgeous."

"If any wine from the Douro has a Bordeaux influence, it is this wine. Produced as part of a joint venture between the Prats family of Bordeaux and the Symington family of the Douro, this wine shows great attention to tannins and structure while allowing the black fruits to shine. It is a stylish wine, powerful while wearing that power lightly. Drink this wine, from a very good year, from 2022."
"This huge, dense and firmly structured bottling absolutely begs for time in the cellar to allow the primary characteristics to mellow and greater elegance and nuance to unfold. Currently, it's an absolute bruiser, with boatloads of plush, ripe black berry and plum characteristics that are coupled with seductive notes of campfire, vanilla bean, Thin Mint, woodspice and licorice root. The assertive tannins produce a bold, extremely firm texture that is in equal measure to the superbly rich and concentrated fruit. Secondary notes of pencil shavings, violets, pipe tobacco and char unfold beneath the fruit, and suggest even further evolution and grace to come with time. Drink 20262038."
"While this wine is rich, it has a classical demeanor, with fine tannins that support but never dominate the ripe black fruits. Full of juicy acidity, it offers black currants and some fine, firm tannins at the end. This will take some time to mature, and the wine will not be ready to drink before 2027."
"Full of black-currant flavor, this firm wine has structure and a rich texture. Its bolstering tannins and vibrant acidity mark out an age-worthy selection. Spice tones and a dry core set the stage for a slow development into an even more complex and fulfilling wine. Drink from 2025."
"Sweet tangerine, pineapple and mango pulsate through this piercing, feather-light wine. It's an exhilarating sweet sip accented by savory nuances of musk and white truffles. Expansive yet thrilling and spry, the finish meanders endlessly. Drinks beautifully now but should hold gorgeously for decades to come."
"While exceptionally sheer, almost diaphanous in texture, this sprightly, sumptuous Riesling offers penetrating layers of honey, melon and pineapple nuanced by spice, hay and crushed earth. It's a spine tingling, concentrated wine, with an endless, rippling finish. Delightful already but sure to hold for decades to come."
"This beautifully golden-colored, oak-aged wine is bone dry, with the intense acidity working with an orange-marmalade character. Together they give a mature wine that is ready to drink."

"Spice and ripe fruit aromas lead into a wine that has both richness and a crisp, fruity herbal character. Acidity shines through, giving the wine a tangy, mineral edginess. It will be a delicious fruity wine. Drink from 2023."
"This dazzling sparkler hits all the right marks. It opens with heady aromas of citrus, bread crust and lemon pastry while the vibrant palate delivers juicy tangerine, Rennet apple and an energizing mineral note alongside an elegant, continuous perlage. Made from 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Nero with no added dosage, it boasts a pristine quality and a pure, crisp finish."
"Bottled in 2017, this wine aged in old oak for 60 years. It still has all the sweetness you would expect from a Bual Madeira while also having that old wood, almost golden character. Acidity balances the opulent fruit. Drink this wine now."

"Demure notes of lemon and crushed mineral on the nose contrast an exuberant palate full of pink grapefruit and hibiscus nectar. It's a gorgeously silky, concentrated dry Riesling, with a firm mineral backbone and electric acidity that need time to meld. Hold until 2020 as it's likely to improve well through 2030."
"First produced in 1991, this wine was a pioneer in the new generation of red wines from the Douro. It is firm with tannins and the strong minerality typical of the Douro. It has weight despite its low alcohol and tense fruitiness. Drink this complex wine with great aging potential from 2020."
"The best bottle in a stellar lineup of the winery's first 2016 releases, this marries old-vine elegance to lush aromatics, with entwined notes of walnuts, raspberries, thyme, rosewater and citrus. It's a long-lasting, beautifully integrated wine, made with grapes from some of the oldest blocks in the vineyard."
"This stunning sparkler is all about precision, finesse and purity. It opens with enticing scents of white spring flower, crushed stone, lemon pastry and hazelnut. The aromas carry over to the chiseled palate together with creamy yellow apple, tangerine zest, brioche and mineral notes alongside an elegant perlage. Vibrant acidity gives it balance and structure."
"Balanced and fragrant, this impressive sparkler offers alluring scents of yellow stone fruit and an inviting whiff of brioche. A blend of 80% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Nero, it's elegantly structured and focused, delivering flavors of yellow apple, white peach, bread crust and crushed stone framed in bright acidity and elegant perlage. A vanilla note lingers on the bone-dry finish. It's extremely well balanced and refined."
"This excellent wine from a steep terraced vineyard offers beautiful aromas of lavender and violet that segue to a palate replete with black fruit, black pepper and anise tones. Each flavor seems especially well defined and they layer together harmoniously on a velvety texture that provides good support for all that concentration. Best after 2020."
The name of this release goes back to the first red wine made by Niepoort in 1990. The wine was made with long old-barrel aging and was not bottled until 2017. Tannins are important to this rich wine; so is the powerful black fruit. They offer an mineral- and fruit-driven wine that still needs to age. Drink from 2020.
"This wine is ripe, rich and generous. It brings out the almost-sweet character of the fruit in this vintage. At the same time, the tannins are firm and support all this fruitiness. The wine will develop well. Drink from 2024."
"This wine offers a compelling nose of pretty florals and spicy forest-floor aromas. Dense on entry, it lingers in flavors of orange, cherry and rhubarb, with textured tannins and an undercurrent of a stony, mineral character."

"This wine offers a compelling nose of pretty florals and spicy forest-floor aromas. Dense on entry, it lingers in flavors of orange, cherry and rhubarb, with textured tannins and an undercurrent of a stony, mineral character."
"Enticing scents of scorched earth, cassis, new leather, vanilla, truffle and Mediterranean brush abound on this classy red. The full-bodied youthfully austere palate is still tightly wound but already shows mature black cherry, raspberry preserve, licorice and grilled herb set against a backbone of firm fine-grained tannins. Give it time to fully develop. Drink 20222030."
"Smoothly textured, this fruity wine offers acidity and ripe apricot flavors. The zesty, mineral texture will allow it to develop well, promising of great fruit and texture in the future. Wait until 2024."
"This powerful wine has great structure, fine and elegant tannins, and ripe black fruits. It wears its heart on its sleeve. The concentration doesn't take away from the juicy fruit and wealth of complex flavors. A wine with a great future, it won't be ready to drink before 2026."
"Perhaps the best vintage of Compostella to date, the 2015 vintage is a blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot, 11% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. It showcases a beautiful elegance and herbal edge in waves of cigar tobacco and blackcurrant leaf, with a grounded fruit core of blackberry, plum and cassis. Additional notes of leather and German chocolate cake lend depth and intrigue, while the finish exhibits a masterful evolution between all these components with each sip. Well-structured and superbly balanced, it boasts gripping tannins and ample acidity to frame the ripe fruit. A beauty that should mature masterfully, drink 20232033."
"Justina is the top wine for this estate, a mellifluous melding of berries and cherries, with a hint of peach. The acids are ample but never intrusive, and bring a rather delicate flavor of lemon oil. Exemplary in every way, this is drinking beautifully but may be cellared for up to a decade."
"Already with a wonderful old-gold color, this aromatic wine with its fruit, acidity and touch of spirit is bone dry, but presents a rich texture. The typical intense acidity is right there as well as lemon peel, wood, spice and concentration. This wine, aged in wood and bottled in 2017, is ready to drink."
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this full-bodied red opens with aromas of wild berry, exotic spice, aromatic herb and a whiff of fragrant blue flower. It's elegant and structured, with a youthful tension that underscores juicy wild cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and a hint of pipe tobacco. Fresh acidity lends balance while fine-grained tannins provide polished support. It's already tempting but will develop even more complexity with cellaring. Drink 20182033."
"This wine is dense with superripe tannins. It has rich black-plum and berry fruits along with an opulent texture typical of this wine in good vintages. Along with its power, the wine has great acidity to keep the aftertaste crisp and fruity. Drink from 2024."
"Jim Barry's top wine and one of Clare Valley's most renowned, the 2012 doesn't disappoint. Enchanting, complex aromas of purple beets, mocha, strawberry leaf, raspberries, figs and dates continue on the palate, all cloaked in savory, powdery tannins and a structure that sets it up for many years of aging. Drink 20192037."
"This is one of the top vineyard selections in this vintage, among a select group, notable for its outstanding focus and concentration. Still compact, its purple fruits are lightly spiced and deftly balanced; leaving little doubt that further improvement is just around the corner. Drink now through 2035."
"The nose is intense and heady, combining unlikely but harmonized elements of white currant, fresh white mushroom, honey, pear and lemon zest. The palate then majors on fresh, pure and fluid pear juiciness. There is a textural element and overtones of beeswax reinforced by more lemon zestiness. A very complex, very alive and facinating wine. This is mouthfilling, long and intense, utterly full-flavored but resolutely dry."
"This particular block selection is focused upon old-vine Pommard grapes, and the result is a layered and deeply focused wine that continually evolves once poured. It's a delicate explosion of textures and flavors, berry and cherry, wet stone, cola and caramel. Though it will surely age beautifully over a decade or longer, if you give it ample aeration and attention, it drinks quite nicely already."
"The vineyard cannot be disclosed, but there's nothing mysterious about the flavor, which pins the meter on the yum factor. Juicy huckleberry flavors come wrapped in mineral-drenched acids. Made from 100% Pommard grapes, this marries Old World complexity to pretty purple fruits. As with many Patricia Green wines, the oak aging is a minor player, while the ripe fruits and individual terroirs are expressed in riveting fashion."
"Wet river rocks and mineral oil juxtapose zesty tangerine, pomelo and grapefruit in this lavish yet composed dry Riesling. It's clingy and plush in mouthfeel yet vibrantly balanced in acidity, with an unctuous and rippling finish. It's stunning already for its youthful fruit and electric acidity, but sure to improve further through 2035."
"Dried sagebursh, wild cherries, rose petals and baked soil aromas make for a compelling blend of savory and sweet on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard on the eastern side of the appellation. A chalky texture and front-to-back acidity presents flavors of ripe boysenberry and black raspberry as well as clove, black pepper and other intriguingly dark spices."
"Long associated with the Graham's name, this quinta makes impressive Ports. This hugely tannic and equally hugely fruity Port has a dry backbone as well as potentially rich black fruits. Acidity and a dry edge give structure to this dense wine. Drink from 2028."
"Tight and firm, this young wine has great potential. The richness, good acidity and minerality promise a great future. Densely textured, it is powerful and very rich. Drink from 2024."
"Instantly gratifying, this wine starts off ripe, focused and compact, with raspberries and pie cherries galore on the nose. Let it breathe and it offers complex acid-driven tones of pineapple and orange peel. Barrel aging shows from start to finish, with rich, toasty aromas and streaks of butter and vanilla cookie. It's delicious from first sniff to last sip."
"Made from the original 150 year-old vinesof which just 800 remainthis wine is made only in the best years. The 2012 is a heady mlange of blue and purple fruits, raspberry leaf, beets, coffee and wet leaves. The medium-bodied palate is approachable now with its silky, sexy tannins, plush fruit and a complex, superlong finish, but this will age beautifully for many years to come. Drink now2027."
"Pretty blossom, guava and pink grapefruit notes abound in this gorgeously perfumed, dry Riesling. It's lively and fresh, but maintains a creamy lusciousness on the palate. Concentrated and zingy, it lingers through a long finish marked by murmurs of astringency. Drinks beautifully already but should improve through 2030 and hold further."
"Demure notes of white blossom, pineapple and lemon amass power and ripeness on the palate of this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. Silken and finely textured, it offers penetrating pink-grapefruit and yellow-peach flavors highlighted by zippy streaks of lemon-lime acidity and a cool, crystalline finish."
"Superrich and undeniably flavorful, this stand-out wine achieves fine balance despite the huge tannins. It has an utterly dark color that stains the glass, wonderful aromas of crushed raspberries and black cherries, and deep fruit flavors that weave through tones of dark chocolate and mint. The mouthfeel is notably dense but somehow gentle. Best from 20202030."
"Fresh Asian pear, lemon blossoms and honeysuckle make for an enjoyable nose on this bottling from a very coastally influenced vineyard just east of Santa Maria. The acidity on the palate is super racy and vibrant, carrying flavors of chalk and lime pith that sizzle long and deep."
"Truffle, flint and wild berry aromas mingle with pipe tobacco and a whiff of new leather on this radiant red. On the savory precise palate, licorice and white pepper underscore a juicy core of red cherry and cranberry alongside a flinty mineral vein. Polished tannins and fresh acidity provide impeccable balance. Drink through 2032."
"Toasty blackberry and cassis aromas are classic for Ribera, while the firm, compact palate is structured but not fiercely tannic. Flavors of spiced blackberry, plum and fig finish with the right interplay between fruit and oak. Drink through 2028."
"Big, potent and deeply concentrated, this holds nothing back with its rich, ripe black-cherry-compote flavor. Lavender overtones lead into more expressive layers of vanilla, black tea and Kahla. It is intense and lingering."
"Fragrant blue flower, wild herb, pipe tobacco and black-plum aromas waft out of the glass. Elegant and concentrated, the smooth delicious palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry preserve and licorice offset by well-knit, velvety tannins. Drink through 2025."

"This quinta, situated in the heart of the Port vineyards, always forms the backbone of Dow's Ports. It makes a densely textured wine, powerful and with immense dusty tannins. These are backed by ripe black fruits, a good balance between sweet and dry, with a good shot of acidity. This complex Port needs to age for many years. Drink from 2028."
"This is winemaker Dianna Novy Lee's debut sparkling wine, blending 56% Chardonnay and 44% Pinot Noir and then aging the wine on the lees for three years before release. It impresses from first sip, showing acid-driven raciness and a core of green apple, lime zest and biscuit flavors that linger. It'll serve well as a delicious aperitif or fitting companion for the table."
"Flowery, fragrant aromas of spring blossoms and pink grapefruit belie the power and intensity found on the palate of this bold, steel-touched Riesling. While dry and medium bodied in style, ripe citrus and crisp stone-fruit flavors penetrate deeply. The finish is long, marked by cool strikes of steel and lime acidity."
"Deep and hearty aromas of black currant, caramel, lilac and a touch of roasted oak show on the dense nose of this wine. It is massive on the palate, but with appropriate balancing factors of entrenched acidity and chalky, sticky tannins that hold up the rich flavors of vanilla, black-plum skin and blackberry sauce."
"Owned by the Wrights, this beautifully proportioned wine is supple and tasty, with berry, cherry and blue plum. The barrel aging adds a dusting of cocoa, and the tannins, ripe and still a bit stiff, add notes of ground coffee."
"Rich tannins and concentration are driven both by ripe black fruits and a strongly mineral texture in this wine. The tannins have been smoothed by wood aging, but that's deceptive. Although the silkiness suggests early drinking, the firmer core suggests aging. Go for aging, because this will be an even more impressive wine from 2021."
"Forward, pristine fruit and mineral intensity align in this penetrating, complex dry Riesling. It offers luminous yellow peach, nectarine and grapefruit flavors offset by dazzling lemon-lime acidity and a firm strike of steely minerality. The palate is creamy and expansive yet finishes with laser-edged precision. Beautiful already but should continue to improve through 2035 and hold further."
"While pristine pink grapefruit, pineapple and peach flavors are crisp and concentrated, this lacy, textured auslese is more a showcase of intensely layered minerality. Invigorating and fresh, it offers deeply embedded veins of salt, dusty slate and smoke that reverberate through a long, honey-kissed finish. Drinks beautifully already but should improve from 2021."
"Tight-grained tannins lie beneath a sleek, sophisticated structure of ageworthy complexity in this old-vine wine made from grapes planted in 1959. Intensely layered, it shows wisps of currant, pencil shavings and aniseseasonings for a lush backdrop of brambly blackberry. Enjoy 20232033."
"Estate-grown fruitprincipally Pinot Noir with 8% Chardonnaygoes into this impressively complex sparkling wine from Trisaetum. It's rich and deep, showing both power and finesse. A fine bead and light details of cocoa, coconut and cream bring exceptional complexity."
"Wild red berry, tilled soil, violet, new leather and a whiff of sandalwood slowly unfold on this fragrant red. The structured savory palate delivers dried black cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and clove framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. A hint of coffee lingers on the close. Drink 20202025."
"A selection made both of grapes in the vineyard and wines in the winery, this rich wine has power and density as well as superb fruits. The well-judged oak aging melds well with the dark fruits and acidity, while the tannins give strength and aging potential. Drink from 2021"
"This is a well-made, small-production wine from the producer's home estate. Inviting in perfumed oak, pencil and cedar, it has brawny power that remains elegant in the glass, with persistent acidity and layers of cassis and cinnamon."
"The style of Warre's Ports tends to dryness, and this fine quinta vintage is no exception. It's dry, but the rich fruit forms a great counterbalance. Dense, still young and bursting with perfumed blueberry fruits, the wine has great promise. Drink from 2027."
Dense tannins and rich black fruits mark out this ripe wine. Its tannins are cushioned by the concentrated but generous black fruits that were organically grown. The wine has great purity as well as structure. Drink from 2024.
"This wine is dense, complex and with great tannins. It is powerful and rich, packed with black fruits. Good acidity gives the wine its freshness, its black-currant fruit and its potential longevity. Rich and with great aging potential, this is becoming a major wine in its own right rather than just a second wine of Cos d'Estournel. Drink from 2025."
"Deep, brooding scents of black plum, cherry and cassis form the soul of this beautiful, richly concentrated wine. Plenty of licorice, cigar-box spice and bittersweet cocoa ride atop the fruit core, while notes of green peppercorn, leather and tobacco flesh out the midpalate and flourish on the finish. The crushed-velvet texture offers ample tannic grip and balancing acidity to keep everything in harmony. While it's hard to resist now, this should shine from 20232028."
"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, baked plum, mint and violet mix with whiffs of dark culinary spice. The ripe chewy palate doles out raspberry jam, fleshy black cherry and licorice set against firm, polished tannins. The juicy fruit flavors deftly support the hefty alcohol. Drink through 2022."
"Musk and earthen complexities of smoke and struck flint meld into sun-kissed yellow cherry and tangerine in this seductive, complex kabinett. It's ethereal and sheer yet boldly penetrating, with a piercing lemon-lime finish. Delicious already but sure to improve through 2022 and hold well beyond."
"This gorgeous, radiant sparkler opens with enticing aromas of ripe orchard fruit, pressed wild flowers and cream-filled brioche. Elegantly sparkling, the bright palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, tangy lemon drop, Alpine herbs and minerals alongside tiny continuous bubbles. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors and lends impeccable balance."
"Just a shade off dry in style, this feather-light dynamo offers bold, concentrated stone fruit and blossom tones, enveloped in rich, penetrating swathes of smoke and earth. It's a gorgeously complex wine, with spine tingling acidity and a delicate, lilting mouthfeel that extends endlessly on the finish. Drinks beautifully already but concentrated and structured enough to improve well through 2030."
"Bright red fruits, sappy acids and citrus highlights combine here. The supporting tannins are ripe and toasty, with a slightly grainy mouthfeel. Suggestions of coffee grounds add further interest to the finish, which expands gracefully as it breathes. This is a wine still pulling itself together and clearly built to expand and improve with further bottle age. Drink now through 2030."
"Lovely black-cherry fruit is the highlight here, with aromatics that elevate the fruit with high-toned intensity. The wine is cloaked with chocolate from barrel aging, and detailed with coffee grounds, graphite and loam."
"Hints of honey, caramelized sugar and ripe tangerine on the nose contrast a palate that's lean and bracingly mineral here. While light bodied and lean, zesty white grapefruit and tart pineapple flavors are piercing and persistent. Tasted in 2017, it's still a taut, nervous wine that needs time to meld. Hold till 2020."
"This is an excellent example why so many go crazy for Pinot Noir. The wine exudes a nourishing warmth that transports you to a cozy country kitchen, with bouquets of drying flowers and currants hanging from the rafters, szechuan beef sizzling in the stir fry, earthy sumac in the spice bowl and smoke from the dying embers of a campfire wafting in through the windows. It's silky and open enough to drink now, but should continue to age well through 2025."
This is a lovely light-bodied wine with serious intent and sophistication. Pear puree and apple skin mingle effortlessly along a plane of gravelly rocky mineral complexity that will show well with a variety of meals.
"Linear and elegant, this vibrancy of this sparkler belies its age. It opens with enticing scents of wild flower, orchard fruit, a hint of hazelnut and a whiff of pastry. The palate shows complexity, depth as well as freshness, delivering Golden Delicious apple, apricot, toasted bread crust and a hint of tangerine zest. Tangy acidity lifts the rich flavors while an elegant mousse lends finesse."
"The terrific texture and wealth of detail makes this truly exceptional. Citrus, mineral, candied pineapple and a hint of honey all combine in a long, dense and bright-tasting wine. In the spirit of Oregon's finest Rieslings, it's both sweet and tart, with a lively inviting mouthfeel."
"Lusty black-fruit aromas are earthy, oaky and smooth, exemplifying an excellent Ribera del Duero. A palate with pulsing acidity tempers rich flavors of blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. Creamy oak and some fire on the finish guarantee that this will evolve nicely through 2028."
"The estate vineyard, now about 15-years-old, delivers spicy black-cherry fruit deftly set against dark toasty barrel flavors. Just one-quarter new French oak was used, but winemaker Mo Ayoub is a barrel master who mixes and matches the oak like a painter mixes his or her colors. There's a strong streak of coffee, and it finishes with light accents of forest mushrooms."
"Produced close to Saint-Estphe, this Merlot-dominated wine is powerful and dense. Great black fruits and juicy acidity contrast with firm tannins and the ripe texture from wood aging. This rich wine will age well. Drink from 2024."
"The rich wood and fruit of this wine already show good balance. The estate, owned by Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, is now on excellent form with this structured wine offering concentration and long-term aging. The tannins and the dry core from roughly equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and a pinch of Petit Verdot promise great potential. Drink from 2025."
"The fifth vintage from this estate since its purchase by the Barton family of Loville Barton in Saint-Julien, this is a generous, structured wine. It has ripe black fruits in profusion that are held together by the serious layer of tannins. Rich and concentrated, the wine will age for many years. Drink from 2024."
"The second wine of Chteau Valandraud, this is rich, spicy with great fruit and firm tannins. The wood aging is still showing but it will soon integrate better with the ripeness of the rich fruit. This wine has weight, plenty of black fruit and acidity. Drink from 2022."
"A closed nose offers a hint of cherry. The palate follows with a balance of pure cherry, firm tannin and bright freshness graced with a touch of dark peony. This is understated, light-bodied but wonderfully elegant and has a habit of growing on you slowly and stealthily. This has a long and lovely resonance."
"This higher-end, elegantly packaged bottling delivers depth, starting with a well-woven, unique nose of baked strawberry, cinnamon, juniper, peppercorns and tobacco. Those elements converge on the palate alongside sandalwood, Montmorency cherry and vanilla, bolstered by a soft but steady acidity."
"There's a lifted, vibrant impression to the nose of this impressive, well-crafted wine. It's a pleasant surprise, as it lends levity and definition to the notes of black cherry, crushed purple flowers, licorice root and earth. The mouthfeel is plush and mouthfilling, yet not oppressively so, with ample acidity and structured but velvety tannins. The rich, ripe and robust palate leads into a long finish. It promises a long life of beautiful evolution ahead, maturing to reveal greater nuance and elegance, so cellar through 2030."
"The 2013 Attunga expresses aromas of blueberries, baking spices, coffee and tarragon. It's currently very youthful, with rich, plush fruit and big fine-grained tannins, but structurally it's set up for a long and beautiful life. Drink 20202037."
"Bright and fresh aromas of pomelo pith, grapefruit flesh, guava skins and tangerine souffle show on the nose of this top-tier Chardonnay by veteran Rick Longoria. Clean and crisp flavors of mandarin pith and a crushed marble minerality give backbone to the richer touches of macadamia nut, cashew and the slightest kiss of buttercream."
"Batuta, named after the baton used by an orchestral conductor to blend various musical instruments together, has splendid structure and fruit. It is richly textured with dense tannins as well as layers of black fruits. It holds fruit from three north-facing vineyards on the south bank of the Douro, giving the wine elegance and potential. Drink from 2020."
"This monumental wine is one for the agesor at least for 15 years. A deep color is followed by gorgeous aromas of rose, dark chocolate and blackberry syrup. The mouthfilling, ripe fruit flavors are concentrated, bolstered by thick, powerful tannins that give it a mouth-puckering astringency. The firmness sets this wine up for a long life. Best from 20222032."
"The new sparkling wine project from Trisaetum is off to a spectacular start. This 100% Chardonnay sparkler is refined and detailed. It keeps a lid on the excessive fruitiness and brings in the minerality, toast and overall finesse of the finest Old World examples."
"The Weber vineyard, originally planted in 1978, shows well with bold bright black-cherry fruit, amplified with lemony acids and flavors of lemon meringue. The lingering midpalate leads gracefully into a smooth, lusciously fruity finish."
"Aromas of struck matches and smoke are pronounced initially but dissipate into elegant mineral complexities on the palate of this intensely fruity kabinett. Juicy tangerine and grapefruit flavors are sweet and zesty, edged by a bracing fringe of astringency on the finish."
"A beautifully pure topnote of black cherry sings on the nose, followed by peony and cinnamon. The palate is luminous in a dark cherry flavor. This wine is profound and concentrated but nothing weighs it down. Drink 20182028."
"This shows beatutifully aromatic notes of fresh Cox Orange Pippin apple, jasmine and rose. The palate brims with these same notions, made bolder by pure, lively lemon freshness. The streamlined palate has a pithy, zesty edge that makes you want to drink more. This is a lovely, concentrated, grown-up Muscat of unusual power. The finish is bone-dry, a little salty and lingering."
"Soft and alluring, this wine opens in bursts of rose petal and black tea, with plenty of baking spices accenting its core of cherry, blueberry and rhubarb. As the wine mellows on the finish, it show a velvety texture of round, supple tannins."
"A whiff of white flowers, then a crush of ripe fruit, and the wine opens with tangy lemon, grapefruit and peach flavors. Notes of citrus rind add depth and the acids strike just the right chord."
"This 11-acre property, centered on an ultramodern winery, is the most northerly estate in Margaux. The wine, with its blend of dark tannins and juicy black-currant fruit, is rich, with impressive concentration and minerality. With weight and a firm core, the wine will age well. Drink from 2025."
"This is a structured wine, beautifully perfumed with richly tannic black fruits. It comes from a large 111-acre estate in the village of the same name. Made to age with firm tannins and layers of sumptuous fruit over firm wood aging, the wine will mature slowly. Drink from 2024."
"This dense and impressively ripe wine comes from a Sorge family estate in the northern part of the Margaux appellation. With black fruits and generous tannins, it is a big wine with considerable richness. This complex wine will age. Drink from 2025."
"This wine comes from a 50-acre crus bourgeois estate in the middle of some of the greatest crus classs estates. The terroir is impressive, giving a rich, structured wine with good concentration, ripe tannins and a sumptuous bed of black fruits. The wine is likely to age well; drink from 2025."
"A touch of orange zest, honeysuckle and rose petals make for a gently aromatic opening. On the palate it is the sheer concentration of flavor that hits you, there seems to be a force of life straining to break free, which swishes across the dry palate in rich flavors of orange zest and florals. This is a vivid, arresting wine which is lovely now but sure has mileage. Drink 20182028."
"Stark, electric acidity bolsters this intensely steely yet deeply fruity off-dry Riesling. It's a cutting, spine tingling wine pulsating with staccato hits of white grapefruit, stone fruit and citrus flavors. The finish is gossamer and sheer yet endless."
"Made with the traditional blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Canaiolo, this opens with aromas of pressed violet, woodland berry, menthol and dark culinary spice. The supple full-bodied palate delivers juicy morello cherry, black raspberry and star anise accompanied by fresh acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2023."
"The Carter is a complex, even rugged wine, replete with layered flavors of herb, black cherry, cola and a touch of molasses. The tannins are as smooth as river rock, with appealing mineral and rock flavors following right behind."
"Far from simply fruity, this is a complex and sophisticated wine that shows how distinctive the grape variety can be. It relies on savory, minerally flavors that have wonderful subtlety and reserve. With each sip it settles a little deeper on the palate, lingering for a long finish buoyed by underlying acidity."
"This new offering from John Kinney's tiny, consistently high-performing winery is big and muscularvery ripe and full bodied, generously laced with butter, toasted oak and almond flavors on a particularly creamy texture but not going over the top. Only about six barrels were made so it's rare, but worth a search."
"Coming from the Rocks District, this offers expressive aromas of potpourri, fresh chopped parsley, orange peel, green olive, smoked meat, fresh flower and wet stone. These lead to plush, palate-coating fruit and savory flavors. Olive and charcuterie notes linger on the finish."
"The result of a joint venture between the Bergqvist family of Quinta de la Rosa and winemaker Jorge Moreira, this wine comes from vines in the Douro Superior region. Rich and dense with black fruits, it is structured and still young. Its intensity and ripe fruits show the warm, dry nature of the vineyards in the region. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019."
"A striking wine, this brand has long been an advocate for Cab Franc in South Africa, and the skill and experience of winemaker Bruwer Raats absolutely shines here. Plush and attractive, yet well defined, it opens with herbal aromas of green peppercorn, tobacco leaf, bark and a touch of pressed iris that weave throughout the ripe blackberry, cherry and currant fruit. Medium-plus in weight, it boasts a crushed-velvet texture and slightly creamy impression, framed by structured tannins and superb acidity to balance. The long finish offers an exercise of evolution, from ripe fruit to fresh earthy tones and finally dried ash and spice. It's hard to resist now, in all its complex, layered glory, but this will mature well through 2028."
"This deep ruby wine offers a bouquet of blackberry, cassis and a slight touch of bell pepper. The full palate is bolstered by opulent tannins, offering flavors of black cherry, black currant and vanilla, with fennel, black pepper and a hint of spice on the finish."
"Extremely light in color in the glass, this bottling of a 40-year-old vineyard block is an old vine masterpiece, starting with aromas of crisp, underripe raspberry, tart carnation and orange rind aromas. It's fresh, light, lovely and very quaffable on the palate, where pomegranate juice is sprinkled with dried oregano and a pinch vanilla dust. The acidity is clean and balanced."
"There's a purity to the black fruit, cocoa, espresso and wisteria aromas on the nose of this bottling from a small dry-farmed vineyard 2,100-feet up in the mountains. The zesty palate throws potpourri and white pepper together with fresh boysenberry and elderberry, making for a uniquely flavored wine, redolent with dried purple flowers."
"This is half barrel fermented and half fermented in stainless steel. It's gritty and expansive on the luxurious palate and well-made, offering layers of apple, pear and melon with a tease of anise on the lengthy full-bodied finish."
"This is a sexy, elegant, light-on-its-feet beauty from one of Tasmania's most highly respected producers. The nose is a heady blend of cinnamon bark, bright red berries, salt and garrigue, while the palate is crunchy and sappy. A picture of drinkability combined with complexity and superb winemaking."
"Wakefield's top wine offers enchanting aromas of mocha, milky coffee, vanilla, licorice and sun-ripened raspberries and blackberries. It's texturally plush, with a fair amount of richness, silky tannins and well integrated oak. This should age with exceptional grace. Drink 20192027."
"This is a stunning example of a wine that's fresh and light yet loaded with flavor. Buoyant aromas of black raspberry juice, dried fennel and wet slate lead onto a palate of snappy, slightly sour pomegranate, white pepper and sumac. The texture is equally complex, while the finish brings additional flavors of candied cherry and strawberry."
"There's a very prominent gamy quality throughout this wine, which starts with aromas of roasted lamb, charcoal, creosote and animal pelt. The palate takes that feral quality even deeper, with hints of Worcestershire sauce, dried lamb and peppery spice. Great for Northern Rhne lovers."
"Rose petal, wild berry, graphite and crushed aromatic herb lead the way. Reflecting the nose, the fresh linear palate offers strawberry, sour cherry, white pepper and a savory saline note. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide graceful support. Drink through 2027."
"Initial cola and root-beer aromas precede floral berry scents. A strict palate is firm but avoids crushing weight. Narrow plum, currant and berry flavors are focused and framed by roaring tannins. This is still young and tough, but with great potential; drink from 20192035."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot, this offers enticing scents of red and black-skinned berry, fragrant purple flower and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. On the fresh, elegant palate, polished tannins support cassis, plum and raspberry alongside culinary spice notes."
"This wine comes from a 10-acre estate that is run by the same team as the much larger Chteau Larose Trintaudon, helping explain its quality and the richness. It has broad tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and a generous, succulent character. It should be aged further so drink from 2024."
"Owner Philippe Raoux has created both a major sculpture park and a series of impressive vintages at this estate at the western end of Margaux. This vintage is one of the best yet, rich and vibrant with great fruits and solid tannins. It needs serious aging, so drink from 2025."
"This wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and a crisp texture. Black-currant flavors and balanced tannins keep it elegant and delicious. It is crisp, fresh and likely to develop over the medium term. Drink from 2023."
"While each of Dalrymple's Pinots are distinctly different, they're all equally delicious. The Coal River will appeal to those funk lovers, with notes of earth, horse saddle, wet leaves, dried currants, orange rind and bitters. The medium-bodied palate is less funky, offering soft tannins and no harsh edges."
"This wine is equal parts Grenache and Mourvdre (co-fermented), finished off with Syrah and aged in neutral French-oak puncheons. The aromas are fascinating, with notes of fresh savory herbs, capers, sea salt, white pepper, bacon fat and mixed fruit. The flavors are plump and appealing, mixing fruity and savory tones that lead to a pepper and olive finish. It's a standout interpretation of this vineyard."
"The top wine from De Ponte, this gets 60% new French oak and a full 15 months in barrel prior to bottling. Those flavors come up quickly, putting a lush vein of butterscotch right down the center. The tangy marionberry fruit is a perfect complement, keeping it fresh and luscious, and suggesting that it will drink optimally for the next decade."
"Charred hickory and cured bacon waft from the glass, overriding but not completely overpowering the lush, fruity center. Waves of velvety tannins brush across the palate, lending structure to the ripe black cherry, blackberry and mashed plum-flesh flavors. Final hints of tree bark, licorice root and black tea unfold on the medium-length finish. It's delicious now, but should evolve well from 20212028."
"This starts out dense and tight, with compact seams of smoke, char, espresso and cacao, sprinkled with dashes of sea salt. It moves into a thick core of mulberry, red currant and black cherry fruit, set in a frame of polished tannins, hitting a faintly green note as it fades."
"This black wine is rich, earthy and chocolaty on the nose, with fully toasted aromas of blackberry and cassis. A massive palate with tannins as heavy as cinderblocks features saturated flavors of blackberry, black coffee and chocolate. A malty, smoky, woody finish is anything but shy. Drink from 20202030."
"With a slight nose of noble reduction, this seductive wine offers a wealth of balanced flavor and body, shining in tones of nuts, fennel, vanilla and mango. The oak is measured and supportive, never getting in the way, allowing the acidity to pierce through the fruit."
"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of dark plum, bramble fruit and thyme. A sense of brightness is ever-present on the palate, with flavors of cherry, cassis, butterscotch, fennel and white pepper. Smooth tannins play on the tongue and then linger just beyond the black-cherry finish, with a touch of caramel."
"This young wine comes up quickly with strawberry fruit, ripe and dotted with white pepper. There are hints of parsley, and impressive midpalate concentration. With all of Ken Wright's wines, which are released quite young, the odds strongly favor additional development and improved complexity with another few years of bottle age."
"Vineyard-designated wines from this appellation are rare, and this wine shows the promise of this site. There's no mistaking the variety, with its enchanting aromas of fragrant flower, smoked meat, chopped parsley, green olive and purple fruit. Flavors are supremely fresh and bright, showing a mixture of fruit and savory, with assorted herb notes intertwined throughout. An extended finish, filled with notes of olive, caps it off. It's beautiful on its own but should sing at the dinner table. Give it time to open up."
"You'll find enticing aromas of black-skinned berry, graphite and Mediterranean brush on this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Teroldego. On the intense palate, notes of tobacco, black pepper and a touch of cocoa add depth to a core of black currant. Velvety tannins provide elegant support. Enjoy through 2026."
"Aromas of red berry, dark culinary spice, wild mint and a whiff of new leather are textbook mountain Nebbiolo. The savory racy palate is loaded with finesse, delivering crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, star anise and tobacco set against taut ultrafine tannins. A mineral note closes the finish while vibrant acidity gives it energy and balance."

A mineral note closes the finish while vibrant acidity gives it energy and balance."
"There's impressive aromatic depth to the nose of this winery's top-tier bottling, with black cherry, olive, wisteria, wet wood, juniper and bay leaf all present. These elements converge on the sip, where black plum, light licorice and loamy earth flavors are enhanced by hints of truffle, nutmeg and vanilla. The tannic texture is upright yet not sticky or in the way."
"Made from organically grown grapes, this wine comes from the plateau north of the Douro river itself. It is a limited-edition wine, rich and tannic at this stage. Alongside all this structure, the wine also has ripe black fruits that are about to burst out, juicy, rich and with final acidity. Drink this wine from 2019."
"This thoroughly delicious wine offers a lush mix of raspberry compote, cherry pie and a touch of lemon curd. The tannins are supple and generous, and the wine glides effortlessly through a yummy midpalate and on into a satisfying finish with a lick of buttery caramel."
"Winemaker Dominic O'Reilly worked for years under Ojai Vineyard Syrah master Adam Tolmach, so it makes sense that his take on this historic property would be so excellent. Aromas of deep black plum fruit are cut by game, tar and wild herbs. The palate shows fresh purple fruit and violets alongside cracked pepper, held up by a strong tannic backbone."
"Made with Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, this offers delicate scents of wildflowers, orchard fruit and a whiff of baking spice. Racy, linear and refreshing, the crisp dry palate delivers Rennet apple, nectarine and a hint of ginger, while a graphite note adds depth. It's elegant, with small, continuous bubbles."
"Distinct tones of cherry pit and cinnamon-clove define the aromatics of this wine. It's a relatively full-bodied style of the variety from the east side of the appellation. Succulent and fleshy, it offers an array of salty, savory notes and is appealing in its velvety texture and roundness. Cola, warm baking spices and orange peel add to the complexity."
"This wine explores the gamy, cool-climate side of Syrah, sourced from the winery's estate vineyard just outside of the Santa Lucia Highlands. Roasted coffee, burnt toast, charred lamb, powdered cocoa and elderberry jam show on the nose, while a gamy flavor comes through even stronger on the firmly structured palate."
"Those who like their Pinot on the savory and earthy side will enjoy this wine. Leading with the aroma of charred, salted meat, notes of bright red fruits and herbal bitters quickly follow along. The light-bodied palate is beautifully composed, offering a wealth of fruit and floral flavors, and a long, savory finish. Drink now2025."
"From a consistently great producer, the 2015 Pipers River offers a wealth of aromas: sunbaked earth, dried leaves, sea spray, cocoa nibs and just-picked forest fruit. The palate is light and elegant, with soft but structured tannins and a cinnamon spice tone. It's totally approachable now but could age another five to seven years if you can bear to wait that long. Drink 20232025."
"Lifted, succulent tones of mango, peach and melon abound in this lip-smacking yet complex auslese. It's boldly concentrated in fruit but exceptionally fine and filigreed on the palate and shaded by nuances of crushed slate, blossom and salt. The finish is piercing and long marked by spine tingling lime acidity."
"Plumes of smoke and dark earth intensify tonic, lime and salty mineral notes in this nimble-footed auslese. It's a bracing, revitalizing wine, balanced by sweet-tart yellow peach and tangerine flavors that pierce through a long, nervous finish."
"Vanilla, sea salt, red berries, florals, smoke and orange zest all swirl together in this silky smooth Pinot. The palate is simultaneously salty and tangy, with flavors of sea spray and dried cranberries and raspberries."
"This wine is a riot of strawberry preserves on the nose, while the palate is full bodied and detailed. It comes with a touch of lemon custard, hints of barrel toast, and an elegant texture."
"Pretty cherry candy flavors hold your attention here, balanced with perfectly ripened tannins. There's a light wash of milk chocolate and it finishes with cinnamon spice. In a stellar lineup of single-vineyard selections, the Shea is always surefire."
"Layers of sweet, sun-kissed honeydew, grapefruit and tangerine flood the palate of this forward yet nuanced wine. There's a delightful cling of honey and nectar on the midpalate but it's counterbalanced neatly by strikes of lemon-lime acidity and an earthen minerality that lingers long on the finish. Drinks beautifully already but should improve further through 2035."
"Derived from an assortment of Dundee Hills vineyards, this pays tribute to the Jory soils of the AVA. Strong mineral accents keep a tight focus on brambly cherry flavors. The barrel aging, which was minimal given the wine's early release, adds just a touch of caramel."
"Across the river from the small town of Pinho and some of the finest Port vineyards, this estate is well situated. This wine comes from 100-year-old vines and boasts great concentration and richness. It is dense and full of black fruits, ripe from a fine year in the Douro. It will age well; drink after 2021."
"This wine comes from an estate owned by the Amorim cork family. Powerful, perfumed tannins and dense texture from the old-vine Touriga Nacional give a rich character to the wine. Big, bold red fruits are laced with acidity and packed with concentration. Drink this wine from 2021."
"This quinta, named after its cypress trees, has produced a firm and structured wine in this vintage. Tannins and a dry core give a great possibility for aging. It is rich and the black fruits will come through the structure. Drink this wine from 2021."
"While lithe and lean in style, this dry Riesling builds in mineral intensity on the palate. Lime, lemon and green apple flavors are vivaciously fresh, fringed by hints of candlewax and blossom. The finish is long, steely and linear."
"Roasted aromas of wet campfire, black pepper and roasted lamb crust meet with a pickled boysenberry scent on the nose of this bottling, the first time that this winery has made two estate Syrahs. (Hillside is the other.) The palate shows a strong lift from tarragon and mint, but the gamy quality is powerful as well as is the spice, with Szechuan peppercorn and kung pao beef flavors."
"Mossy forest floor, pine needle, juniper and black pepper aromas show against a backdrop of elderberry on the extremely compelling nose of this bottling by Ernst Storm from a vineyard to the northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills. The palate shows much more of that foresty spice, as well as tapenade, wild berries, bay leaf and thyme."
"In most years, Alabaster blows you away with its power, concentration and depth of flavors. In 2014, a mediocre year in much of Northern Spain, this is still excellent. Blackberry, cassis and creosote aromas are toasty, while this is flush in feel and severely tannic. Blackberry, mocha and coffee flavors finish with creamy oak and chocolate notes along with meaty tannins. Only 100 cases produced; drink through 2030."
"Very pure notes of red cherry fill the nose. The same pure fruit is framed by bright, luminous freshness on the palate, which echoes in flavors of cherry, pepper and licorice. An aromatic, fresh and vivid Pinot made with a light touch."
"Light in color, this wine offers beguiling aromas with notes of fire pit, flower, stem, potpourri, black raspberry and smoked meat. Ethereally light and enchanting, it's texturally rich and flavorful, with a warm finisha delicious example of this site and variety."
"Beautifully inviting in aromas of caramelized biscuit, vanilla wafer and baked apple, this is a creamy and lush white wine, full bodied and highly ripe in style. A lovely hit of tangerine-laced acidity keeps it fresh and fleshy."
"Drake Whitcraft is becoming a master at weaving a wide array of sensory experiences into very light wines. This starts with candied pomegranate, fennel bulb and cracked white pepper on the nose, then hits the palate with bright snappy red fruits, heavy peppery spice and a penetratingly bright acid profile. It goes down easy, but with complexity."
"This is a blockbuster wine, full bodied and ripe, yet able to hold its considerable power in check. Its well-integrated oak and sizable structure give it weight and breadth, as well as age-worthy intrigue. Red currant, cedar and cigar box mark the flavor profile. Enjoy best 20242034."
"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems manages to tame the richness of this vineyard while retaining its hedonistic joy. Aromas of rose, pomegranate, hibiscus, rhubarb and dark spice lead into pillowy flavors of strawberry, raspberry and clove. This wine feels light and racy yet full of body and flavor."
"This sappy, sensational effort is bursting with an ultraripe flavor of crushed blueberry. Dusty tannins and a sprinkling of coffee grounds amplify the finish, with excellent texture and length, ending on a flourish of butterfat."
"Pristine aromas of white melon, green plum, apple blossom and lemon leaf open the nose of this gorgeous white, with touches of fresh fynbos and almond skin for added depth. The palate offers a pithy, lightly astringent texture that supports the soft fruit flavors. This is more about structure, balance and feel than overt fruit tones, with the overall harmony and complexity to continue to evolve well through 2030. The palate is very well balanced with fine acidity, more a textural delight than overt flavors with sublime orange pith, walnut and saline notes on the ethereal finish."
"This is a complex and delicious wine that's completely inviting now, but should continue to hold well for another 510 years. Earthy, herbal notes of tobacco leaf, leather, cigar box and crushed violets open the bouquet, grounded by a core of lush, ripe blackberry, currant, raspberry sauce and blueberry crumble. The mouthfeel is full and robust, yet structured by fine but present tannins and bold spicy tones that carry through to the enduring finish. Drink now2022."
"Wild berry, rose petal, smoke, new leather and alpine-herb aromas make for a delicate bouquet. Focused and savory, the bright, elegant palate delivers cranberry, pomegranate, white pepper and black tea framed in taut refined tannins and bright acidity. A tangy saline note lingers on the close. While some may find this almost too austere, if you love finesse you'll be captivated. Drink through 2027."
"This complex and engaging wine threads together equal portions of red fruits, leather, coffee, chocolate and toasted coconut. The tannins retain some palate-clinging astringency, and the aging in one-quarter new French oak puts a wreath of light smoke around the finish."
"Enticing scents of white spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of pastry take center stage on this elegant sparkler. Made entirely with Chardonnay, the graceful palate doles out white peach, yellow apple, lemon and a hint of brioche alongside bright acidity and a silky perlage."
"Toasted aromas of brioche and hazelnut meld with whiffs of yellow stone fruit. On the structured palate, a lively elegant perlage underscores Golden Delicious apple, bread crust, white peach and nectarine drop. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors."
"This is dense and concentrated, reflecting the character of Haut-Brion itself. It has weight, firm tannins and power alongside juicy black fruits and acidity that will give great pleasure as they develop. Drink from 2023."
"This is the Pauillac-appellation portion of a larger vineyard, Chteau Peyrabon, which is in the Haut-Mdoc. The wine is rich, perfumed and likely to age very well. Juicy acidity and firm texture go with the black-currant fruit in a wine that will become balanced and elegant. Drink from 2024."
"The small vineyard in Soussans in the northern part of the Margaux appellation has produced this richly structured wine. Dark tannins and layers of wood aging are accompanied by black-currant fruits as well as dark-chocolate flavor. This wine needs to age, and will be best from 2023."
"With Michel Rolland as consultant and the Cuvelier family, also owners of Loville Poyferr in Saint-Julien, in charge, no wonder this is an impressive wine. It has put on weight since it was tasted at en primeur. Packed with tannins, dark fruits and potential, it is a wine for aging. Solid tannins march along with the black fruit, acidity and spice from wood aging. The wine will take its time and will not be ready before 2025."
"This is the luxury cuve from vineyards in the Seze family since 1918. With its perfumed fruits and firm tannins it is serious as well as sumptuous. It has weight and a dry texture that will soften into the blackberry fruits and generous structure. This wine, with its still-firm texture, needs to age, so drink from 2022."
"A blend of 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot Nero, this offers enticing scents of brioche and yellow stone fruit. The elegant, focused palate delivers golden apple, bread crust, pomegranate and a mineral note alongside a refined perlage and vibrant acidity."
"Paso Robles winemaker Tyler Russell applies that region's rich style to Sta. Rita Hills fruit for massive effect, great for lovers of ripeness and density. Aromas of baked vanilla cake, black cherry, loamy soil and star anise leap from the glass. Then the palate delivers loads of blackberry compote, licorice and clove, letting it all hang out yet bolstered by bright acidity and firm lavish tannins."
"Pomegranate, carnation, dried cranberry, potpourri, baked earth and vanilla cookie all come to the fore on the nose of this light but expressive wine from the historic vineyard. Stewed red cherry and cranberry arise on the palate alongside thyme, peppercorn and the slightest hint of game."
"This deep violet-red colored wine has a nose of cassis, lavender and anise. It is surprisingly soft on first sip, with tannins that gradually increase in power while showcasing flavors of black cherry, dark plum, cranberry, fennel bulb and a touch of mint. The slightly grippy finish offers pronounced notes of cherry and orange zest."
"This flagship bottling is still a whopper of a wine. This vintage, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 12% Merlot, offers barely ripe black cherry, green peppercorn and charred fennel on the nose. The palate is loaded with both savory and ripe flavors, from roasted black plums and charred beef to oregano and dill. Very complex and chalky in texture."
"Firm and focused, this young wine has miles to go. It opens with bright raspberry and cherry fruit, then puts on bulk in the midpalate, adding lovely orange-peel highlights. Drinking well this young, it has the structure and depth to add many more layers over the next decade or longer. Drink now through 2030 and beyond."
"There is a certain high-toned intensity to many of Ken Wright's 2015s, which amps up the young fruit. Here the dominant flavors are ripe strawberry, vivid and layered against firm ripe tannins. There's a touch of coffee and dark chocolate running through the finish. For reasons unknown, this new cuve bears the old Ken Wright label design."
"This radiant savory mountain Nebbiolo opens with enticing scents of wild berry, flint, smoke and a whiff of alpine herb. It's elegant and focused, delivering crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, tobacco and star anise alongside taut refined tannins and bright acidity. It's already tempting but will develop even more complexity over the next several years or more. Drink 20202032."
"Enticing scents of yellow stone fruit, acacia and brioche show this wine's Chardonnay pedigree. A refined beading and tangy acidity lend elegance and balance to flavors of creamy yellow pear, apple and lemon. A hint of fennel graces the finish."
"Concentrated tangerine and candied lemon-peel flavors are juxtaposed by complexities of savory earth and smoked nuts. While off dry and sprightly, there's a lusciousness that builds on the midpalate that extends into a long, lavishly fruity finish."
"Deep and dark in the glass, this Petite Sirah-dominant blend offers aromas of pure blackberry jam on the nose with hints of dried wild fennel and charred plum. It's rich and dense on the palate, but vivacious with fresh black-fruit energy and lifted by clove and purple-flower flavors. The acidity is bright, and tannins are firm but set in the background."
"A stunning wine, this opens with scents of golden straw, honeydew rind, firm nectarine and fresh honeycomb that all carry through to the medium-weight mouth. The palate boasts a flinty, mineral texture and bright acidity that lends verve and precision to the notes of toasted apple, spiced orange rind and pressed yellow flowers. Hints of fresh herbs and minty fynbos grace the enduring finish. It sure is delicious now, but try this stunner from 20202028."
"Aromas suggesting steeped prune, dark culinary spice, new leather, tobacco and balsamic notes lead the nose. The aromas follow over to the firmly structured palate along with raisin and licorice, while tightly knit fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the austere framework. A smoky mineral note lingers on the finish. Drink 20192026."
"This new release, a limited production wine from this estate, is named after Tim Bergqvist, the patriarch of the family that owns this property. The wood aging has given richness, almost creamy sweetness to the ripe fruits. The attractive slight oxidation adds complexity to what is already a fine wine. Drink from 2019."
"Almost black in color, this rich, unctuous wine at first seems smooth. Ripe black-plum and jammy berry fruits are ripe and dense. Behind that generous exterior, firm tannins and a dense structure will allow the wine to age well. Drink after 2026."
"This wine is richly layered, offering a density of brick, toasty char and dusty rock flavors and aromasa muscular showing from a warm vintage. Black pepper, leather and dried herbs provide additional complexity around a full-bodied core."
"Lots of herbs, dried red currants and cranberry compote aromas show on the nose of this bottling, which has an earthy, gamy undercurrent. The palate tastes like it has more age on it, which is a good thing for now, with flavors of charred wood, damp forest floor, dried fruit and allspice, all riding a squeaky texture."
"Tangy, savory and elegant, this bright, silky sparkler offers inviting aromas and flavors of Golden Delicious apple, tangy tangerine drop, white peach, mineral and herb. A creamy mousse lends even more finesse while cream-filled brioche lingers on the finish."
"The ??? Pinots from Ayoub are made with fruit sourced from such excellent sources as Arcus, Renegade Ridge and Winderlea. Here, as elsewhere, the barrel management is as important as the fruit, putting a concise frame of toast around tight well-defined red-berry and black-cherry flavors. Streaks of cola and coffee add further interest through a lingering finish. Drink now to 2030."
"A very intriguing hint of nettle plays along with the orange and mandarine zest aromas, creating a perfumed whiff of utter freshness. On the palate it is apple and orange ripeness that create a sort of dry, juicy richness and concentration. This is an unusual but utterly seductive Muscat."
"This rich, dense vintage Port is produced by Niepoort. It has immense tannins as well as layers of ripe fruit. The concentrated texture, powerful dry core and the richness of the wine promise good aging. Drink from 2028."
"One of the properties owned by the Chanfreau family of nearby Fonraud, this 14-acre estate has produced a structured, toasty wine. Its high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon gives it plenty of juicy black currants as well as fruit tannins. The wine needs to age and should be drunk from 2025."
"Biodynamically grown, the grapes from this estate offer structure, concentration and a delicious balance between fruit and tannins. The wine has a serious side, with its dense texture and a straight line of pure black fruits. Drink from 2025."
"This is a rich wine with generous tannins and, more importantly, generous black fruits. It has a soft texture, the tannins fine and well integrated into the juiciness. It will be a delicious, fruity wine. Drink from 2022."
"Produced from a Domaines Fabre parcel of old vines, this wine is rich, firm and concentrated. Wood aging has left its mark of toast and spice without losing the generous fruits. It is an elegant wine, full in the mouth and with great balance between all its elements. Drink from 2022."
"From the southern part of the Haut-Mdoc, this Tessandier family wine is a richly structured blend with Cabernet Sauvignon dominant. It has a dry, firm and densely tannic structure along with ripe and potentially generous blackberry fruit. The combination will allow this dark, firm wine to age well. Drink from 2024."
"From a grand estate, whose owners also have vines in Margaux and Moulis, this wine is well proportioned and dense. Rich tannins and concentration are just part of what will become a generous, full wine. With great black-currant fruit and acidity to match, this structured wine will need to age. Drink from 2024,"
"This deep garnet colored wine has aromas of strawberry, black cherry and fennel. Opulent tannins offer a rich mouthfeel, providing a backdrop for flavors of black cherry, black currant, mocha, pencil lead and lavender that wrap up in a cranberry finish."
"Aged in neutral French oak, this has aromas that start out brooding but intriguing, with notes of raw meat, mineral, dried herb, crushed flower and huckleberry. The palate is earth-shaking in its richness and intensity, coating the palate with waves of fruit flavors. It hits the gong hard but maintains a lovely sense of balance."
"This wine erupts from the glass, with aromas of brown sugar, candied pineapple, dried orange rind and flower. Flavors are viscous, intense and rich, with a mango-filled finish that sails. It's the perfect end to any evening."
"Dark violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of blackberry, black cherry and vanilla. Flavors of black plum, blueberry, vanilla, clove and pipe tobacco are set into a framework of silky tannins that reed into a smooth cherry finish."
"Thrilling lime acidity and smoky, savory mineral tones meld beautifully in this delicately off-dry feinherb kabinett. It's finely textured and nimble but crisp yellow peach and apricot flavors penetrate firmly on the palate. The finish is lingering and silky, marked by hints of spice, struck flint and pollen. A fascinating wine that's likely to improve. Drink from 2020."
"The faintest touch of mocha and vanilla play enticingly on the dark-cherry nose. The palate is full of ripe red cherry, has a glossy, luscious sheen of oak, but handles it very well. A more international style but still with all the hallmark freshness and brightness of Alsace. Drink 20182025."
"This is a densely packed, powerful and ripe wine from a tremendous site in the heart of the appellation. Black cherry, dark chocolate and coconut shavings make for a rich impression on the velvety palate, with plenty of toasted oak for support. This wine will do well in the cellar. Enjoy from 20242034."
"Grenache (69%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Mourvdre (26%) and a pinch of Syrah. Aged in neutral French oak, it offers aromas that aren't yet ready to reveal their charms on first pour. Notes of spice, herb and black pepper evolve into smoked meat and raspberry accents over time. The palate is swoon-worthy, with soft, supple fruit and savory flavors that lead to a persistent finish. The sense of purity dazzles."
"The merest hint of mandarin peel plays on the nose. This is heightened on the slender, dry palate which seems to have a pithy depth of citrus peel and the airy lightness of a cloud of mandarin. There is ample freshness here as well as elegance and persistence. The finish is off-dry and long."
"At first, this wine smells a bit burnt. But airing allows this gran reserva to show mature aromas of grilled beef, dry leaves and spice. Hard tannins make for a rubbery mouthfeel, but savory flavors of leafy plum and berry fruits bring it around. A finish with baked fruit and chocolate flavors concludes this classical Rioja. Drink through 2025."
"Blackberry aromas are deep and ripe, with woodsy side notes. A powerful palate is sinewy but not overly rugged or tannic. Blackberry and toasty flavors of chocolate and brown sugar smolder across a strident finish; drink through 2022."
"Tangs of lime and salt penetrate through delicately sweet layers of grapefruit and tangerine in this pristine, laser-edged Riesling. It's spine tingling yet honeyed by a long, intensely mineral finish."
"Aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and underbrush lead the nose on this savory blend of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet and Sangiovese. The chewy palate delivers black-currant jam, mocha and star anise alongside polished, velvety tannins. Drink through 2027."
Rounded black currants and a hint of prune mix with chocolate and black pepper on the nose of this very rich and powerful bottling from Paso Robles. The palate is thick and gooey with pepper spice cutting through the black-plum-cake flavors. Firm tannins and enduring acidity hold everything in check.
"Blackberry and prune aromas are smoky and suggest hoisin or barbecue sauce. This Monastrell-Garnacha blend is a bit drawing and wiry on the palate, while flavors of toasty oak, blueberry and savory plum are bold. Oak character dominates a clampy, grating finish. Drink through 2023."
"Full body and lots of toasted oak character give this reserve-style wine plenty of impact in the aroma, flavor and finish. Tempting scents of toasted almonds, vanilla and grilled baguette lead to concentrated pear, butter and cream on the palate, while the texture is powerful and velvety."
"Red cherry, rust, cinnamon, vanilla and wet herbs make for a crisp and compelling nose on this bottling by winemaker Tim Slater, who manages to elicit cooler climate properties from a warmer region. A wide array of herbs, including thyme, oregano, marjoram and sage, decorate the firmly structured hibiscus, red currant and cranberry backdrop. The acid goes deep into the finish."
"This is a mouthwatering, succulent kabinett chock full of sweet-tart guava and white grapefruit flavors. It's silken and sweet yet elegantly spry and mineral. Delightful now but likely to hold well through 2026."
"Chewy and intensely herbal, this bold, powerfully built wine is bittersweet in tobacco and cigar box elements. The fruit leans into dark cherry and cassis, with a dusting of cocoa powder seasoned seductively throughout."
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, Spanish broom, toasted nut and a whiff of sage. The aromas follow over to the palate along with mature golden apple, bread crust, ginger and dried citrus zest alongside an elegant, persistent perlage. Fresh acidity lifts the dry finish."
"Exhibiting all that one could hope from a coastal site, this wine offers earthy rose petal aromas around a tightly wound core of forest and tea. Structured tannin provide a framework for secondary characteristics to develop in the glass, from cranberry and orange peel to Asian five spice."
"This is a light, ethereal and hugely satisfying wine, delicately layered and soft in texture. Huckleberry, Asian five spice and forest floor figure prominently along a succulent persistence of acidity and salty freshness."
"This single-vineyard wine is rock solid, with punchy black-cherry fruit, a streak of mineral and a sprinkling of coffee grounds. Clean earth and graphite add more complexity, and the tanninsripe and sturdyprovide a perfect foundation. The wine was aged for 17 months in one-third new French oak, and should drink well into 2028."
"This is an inaugural blend of 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc made by Dan Petroski of Larkmead for the new producer. The grapes come from vineyards located near the winery in Oak Knoll. Dried herb de Provence aromas invite one in to mingle with aspects of cedar, pencil and red currant, the style subdued and soft. Layers of quiet power and oak lie beneath the fruit."
"Candied black cherry, rosebuds, violets and a minty tobacco quality all show on the nose of this countywide blend by Bruno D'Alfonso. It commands attention on the palate, showing black currant, blueberry, black-pepper-crusted beef and candied violet flavors, balanced by strong acidity."
"Roasted cocoa, espresso cream and caramel provide richness to the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend, but there's also bright black raspberry fruit and hints of pepper and fennel to give complexity. The palate starts with a zip, which dissipates into flavors of lilac, blueberry and anise seed."
"The 70% of Merlot in the blend of this wine gives it richness and ripe red-berry fruits. The tannins, dusty and spicy, are a blend of the wood aging and the structure of the Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe and juicy, the wine is packed with fruit and likely to age well. Drink from 2022."
"Ripe, and densely textured, this wine shows an impressive, rich balance between fruit and tannins, with a dry core and broad black fruits that have great intensity. This wine, with 12 months in wood, conveys spice, concentration and excellent potential. Drink from 2024."
"Run by the Nony family, this 17-acre estate has produced a generous, rounded wine dominated by black fruits. The barrel aging has enhanced the black-currant flavors and the acidity. All these elements are coming together in a full wine that will age well. Drink from 2024."
"This rich wine comes from a historic estate in Listrac, dating to the 18th century. It offers tannins and a dry core as well as dark black fruits and acidity, giving the wine its structure and potential longevity. The wine will develop slowly and will be ready to drink from 2025."
"Old vines on the estate, close to the ancient city walls of Saint-milion, produce this smoothly ripe wine. It is broad, generously rich with black fruits. The toast from wood aging will integrate with time. Wait until 2024 for this impressive wine to be ready to drink."
"Aromas reminiscent of bread crust, nut and orchard fruit carry over to the vibrant linear palate along with pomegranate and citrus zest notes. Bright acidity and a lively elegant perlage provide support and energy."
"Woodland berry, dark culinary spice, tilled earth and new leather aromas combine with whiffs of aromatic herb on this fragrant graceful red. The vibrant palate is all about balance and finesse, offering strawberry, red cherry, star anise and a hint of white pepper balanced by bright acidity and polished tannins. If you love extreme elegance, this is for you. Drink through 2024."
"A robust and flavorful Chardonnay, this exhibits superb balance between the ripe fruit, woodspice and vibrant acidity. Notes of baked apple, clove-spiked orange, toasted hazelnut and peach pit abound on the nose and palate, with added hits of citrus pith, honeysuckle and lemon verbena that add grace and elegance. It's medium in weight, with a lightly textured grip and lively acidity that lifts the sweet-spiced finish. It's hard to resist now, but should mature well through 2023."
"This wine has a classic nose of pencil shavings, cedar and ripe black plum, following through on the palate in similar fashion. Full bodied and highly concentrated, it layers in flavors of cherry compote and dark chocolate."
"From the winery's Mountain Terrace Vineyard 1,700-feet up, this is a floral, subdued and brightly woven red wine. Vanilla and milk chocolate flavors provide a richness and likability, with a pronounced bite of oak and tannin on the finish."
"This wine has inviting caramel-apple aromatics, which follow along a subdued palate of ripe texture and oak. A brightness of orange blossom and tangerine add freshness and vibrancy to the lush fig-filled surroundings, dotted in nutmeg."
"Heady aromas of sun-kissed mango, peach and melon are cut by blades of steel and stone in this captivating kabinett. It's delightfully spry in texture, offering loads of crisp-tart yellow peach and nectarine flavors highlighted against streaks of lime acidity. The finish is fresh and mineral-laden."
"This reserve-level best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak. It's dark, chewy and toasty, with black cherry, black coffee and dark chocolate all in the mix of flavors. A solid and substantial wine, it drinks well young and may best be consumed over the next five years."
"Ripe berry aromas with a touch of root beer are lush and soft. That is not the case on the palate, which is tight in the middle and scratchy along the edges. Blueberry and black-currant flavors are a touch minty, while this wine displays chocolate and lemon-peel notes on a tough, pulling finish. Drink through 2030."
"This is a stainless steel bottling done right. Citrusy aromas of lime peel, orange pith, just-ripe Asian pear and a flash of sweet butter show on the nose. The texture is phenomenally grippy on the sip, where flavors of crushed chalk meet with yuzu zest, nectarine and white peach, remain brisk throughout. Pink-grapefruit zest carries the finish."
"This is based upon a single Dijon 115 clone, and delivers potent ripe black-cherry flavors. It's a full-throttle bottle, textural and lightly touched with dried seaweed. The barrel aging adds a welcome touch of chocolate to the powerful tannic finish."
"This bright, big and mouthfilling wine was fermented with wild yeast, which seems to infuse it with a dollop of mystery. Ultraripe lemon and grapefruit come with a hint of marshmallow and plenty of toasted-peanut flavors. It finds a smooth runway and coasts gently to a gliding stop, with those toasty flavors still resonating."
"Based at Quinta de Roriz in the Douro, this wine is produced by a joint venture between the Prats family of Bordeaux and the Symington family of the Douro. Made as a second wine to Chryseia, it is soft and rich, with great tannins and ripe fruit. Black currants and acidity go together with a young, dry core. Drink from 2020."
"Based on old Tinta Roriz vines, this elegant wine is ripe and densely structured, with good balance between red fruits and juicy acidity. It is a wine to age for several more years. Drink from 2021."
"Exhibiting all that one could hope from a coastal site, this wine offers earthy rose petal aromas around a tightly wound core of forest and tea. Structured tannin provide a framework for secondary characteristics to develop in the glass, from cranberry and orange peel to Asian five spice."
"This is a light, ethereal and hugely satisfying wine, delicately layered and soft in texture. Huckleberry, Asian five spice and forest floor figure prominently along a succulent persistence of acidity and salty freshness."
"This single-vineyard wine is rock solid, with punchy black-cherry fruit, a streak of mineral and a sprinkling of coffee grounds. Clean earth and graphite add more complexity, and the tanninsripe and sturdyprovide a perfect foundation. The wine was aged for 17 months in one-third new French oak, and should drink well into 2028."
"New leather, baked plum, truffle and fruitcake aromas rise up from the glass. It's rounded and full bodied, with velvety tannins that underscore fig, steeped prune, cinnamon, graphite and chewing tobacco. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors. Drink through 2023."
"Yellow flower, bread crust, ripe orchard fruit and graphite scents mingle together in the glass. It's loaded with finesse, offering Golden Delicious apple, peach and tangerine zest balanced by bright acidity and a refined perlage."
"All Dijon clones from the Alloro vineyard, this tightly wound effort mixes tree-fruit flesh and skin flavors in a compact balanced wine with some good years of life ahead. There's a pleasing nuttiness resonating through the finish, from a small percentage that was fermented in new French oak. Give it an extra year or two in bottle and it should open up nicely."
"This lovely wine shows its dark side throughout, mixing black fruits with strong flavors of black coffee. Barrel aging, just under a year in one-quarter new French oak, brings up flavors of dark chocolate and chicory. It's delicious and substantial, ready for drinking over the next half decade or longer."
"Demeter-certified biodynamic grapes go into the making of this light and delicate winea fine example of coastal cooling. Layered in earthy rose petal and cardamom, it shows length and breadth around a quiet core of tart rhubarb and pomegranate."
"A blend of 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero, this refined sparkler opens with heady aromas of white wild flower, citrus and a whiff of bread crust. On the lively palate, fresh acidity brightens creamy white peach, Golden Delicious apple and lemon drop. A brioche note wraps up the finish."
"Bright and savory, this refreshing, polished sparkler boasts alluring aromas of juicy raspberry, wild cherry, baking spice and a whiff of bread crust. The inviting aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with a continuous refined perlage. A tangy candied nectarine note closes the finish."
"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah vineyards, this offers high-toned aromas of potpourri, red and blue fruit, sage, bacon fat, iron and spice. These lead to supple, restrained smoked meat and red-fruit flavors, stretching out on the finish. It brings a sense of elegance, taking some time to get going before strutting its stuff."
"Bright and delicately scented, this elegant sparkler evokes aromas of spring wild flower, white stone fruit and crushed herb. The bright palate offers Rennet apple, Anjou pear, pastry cream and tangy lemon drop. It's balanced with fresh acidity while a silky mousse lends finesse."
"Exotic spice, pressed violet and woodland-berry aromas create an inviting bouquet. The linear elegant palate delivers tart cherry, strawberry, licorice and white pepper while bright acidity and firm refined tannins provide balance and support. A note of orange zest closes the finish. It's still young so give it time to fully blossom. Drink 20192028."
"In the opulent, concentrated school of thought this wonderful luxurious-tasting wine is shaped by very ripe fruit flavors and generous helpings of suave oak. Flavors run from marzipan to honeysuckle and poached pears, and a nicely viscous texture fills the mouth and helps the finish linger."
"Close to some of the top Margaux vineyards, this estate regularly produces some fine wines. This bottling is beautifully structured, firm with tannins and also generous with black fruits. A high percentage of Merlot gives a particularly ripe and juicy wine that will age over the medium-term. Drink from 2022."
"From vineyards surrounding the medieval moated castle, this wine is well balanced, rich and yet structured. It has great blackberry fruit and dry tannins for aging and it's coming together well. Drink from 2022."
"Ripe and densely textured, this is a plush, full-bodied wine. With swathes of rich black fruits and some firm tannins, it has good potential. The richness contrasts with the black-currant acidity that gives this otherwise dense wine a bright, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2024."
"Purchased by Olivier Decelle, who also owns property in Saint-milion and a negociant business in Burgundy, this estate is producing impressive wines. This bottling is richly structured while preserving all the ripe blackberry fruits and intense acidity. Drink this wine from 2023."
"This wine, full of dusty dry tannins as well as ripe black-currant fruit, blends equal proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Its richness comes from the full fruitiness as well as the dry core that will allow the wine to age. It needs time and should not be drunk before 2024."
"Dark and dense, this wine has good aging potential, with black fruits as well as a dry core of tannins. Minerality shows through in the texture of the wine. It is rich and generous, reflecting the vintage. Drink from 2024."
"Made with organically grown Pinot Nero, this vibrant sparkler has subtle aromas of wild berry, crushed herb and an apple orchard in bloom. Structured and elegant, the savory palate delivers tart red cherry, raspberry compote, baking spice and a hint of brioche set against bright acidity. Small continuous bubbles provide the refined perlage."
"Showing its age well, this pure expression of Negroamaro immediately engages the nose with aromas of concentrated berries, wild herbs and a hint of hoisin sauce. Round in feel, with structured acidity and supportive, fine-grained tannins, the palate offers a wealth of vitality in fresh red cherry, cranberry and streaks of granite. Savory herbs and earth tones linger on the finish. This is in a sweet spot now, so drink soon."
"The nose is very shy but gives the slightest promise of ripe, red fruit. Red cherry appears in full splendor on the palate, edged by racy, exciting freshness and superfine but crunchy tannins. The body remains slender but there is a sensuous, warm core of ripe fruit. Lovely now but will develop over the coming five years. Drink 20182025."
"This is fresh, aromatic and primary in cherry aromas. The same luscious, generous fruit also dominates the juicy palate. There is freshness to balance this abundance but this is hedonistic and fruit driven to the core, with a cinnamon undertone. Drink 20182025."
"The nose offers lovely touches of stone, fern and white pepper, with the freshness of green apple. There is something pristine about this wine, something light, clear and utterly moreish. The finish is clean and dry."
"While feather light and ethereal in texture, there's an abundance of plump, juicy yellow cherry, guava and even strawberry fruitiness here. It's unabashedly forward and fruity yet racy and fresh. The finish lingers on a lovely floral tone."
"Hints of caramelized sugar, pollen and orange peel glaze this succulent, lip-smacking Riesling. Its delicate sweetness is bolstered by sunny squirts of orange and yellow peach, but balanced neatly against a solid backbone of lime acidity. A deeply penetrating sptlese with a long burnt-sugar finish."
"A cool, steely undertone intensifies crisp, yellow stone fruit and lime on the nose and palate. With electric, sweet-tart darts of honey and nectar, this is a piercing, concentrated wine that has a long lime-pith finish."
"Intoxicating notes of exotic spice, smoke and crushed earth intensify flavors of pristine white grapefruit and peach in this tantalizing kabinett. Deeply penetrating in fruit and vibrantly balanced in acidity, it finishes with a long, crystalline finish."
"Dusty earth and smoke tones are predominant on first whiff but open gradually, offering a succession of ripening fruits from fresh lime and gooseberry to crunchy peach and pink grapefruit. It's a spry, taut wine, with scintillating acidity and a long crystalline finish."
"This wine is a blend of 49% Syrah, 38% Grenache and a whopping 13% Viognier, with the latter expressing itself on both the aromas and palate. The wine pops, with notes of freshly peeled orange, stargazer lilly, gravel, olive, smoked meat, blueberry and boysenberry. Soft and sumptuous, the palate shows a lot of elegance and expression along with an extended finish."
"Pronounced aromas of struck match and flint belie the intensity of fresh grapefruit and lemon at the core of this delicately off-dry wine. It's more earth and herbs than forward or fruity but there's a savory intensity here that's beguiling. It's a wine that should improve with some cellaring, try after 2020."
"This is the top cuve from the winery, and just a single barrel was produced. It's packed with baking spices, vanilla, black tea and cardamom. These are more than highlights: they are a substantial element, along with ripe black fruits. This was all whole-cluster fermented, and aged for 18 months in barrel."
"This typifies the best wines from this AVA, with well-matched components. Ripe sweet red berries are at the core, with accents of dried herbs and a whiff of cannabis. Everything is smoothly integrated and works well as a seamless whole."
"There are the typical rich aromas of blackberry pastry and black plum on the nose of this Zinfandel, but also a flowery elegance and savory hints of char. The palate is quite interesting, with powerful cracked pepper, dried herb and charred wood decorating the pure black plum backdrop and a long caramelized finish. A compelling take on Zin."
"This wine is super dark in hue and packed full of blackberry, wood smoke and black pepper flavors. It brings a relatively light (for the varietal) mouthfeel considering that it does have a wealth of fine-grained tannins and elevated alcohol. Drink now with a steak or chop, or cellar until 2025 for more maturity and nuance."
"This is in its infancy now, but it's remarkably refined and nuanced, showing great promise for evolution and development. Notes of melon rind, orange peel, lemon verbena and fresh fynbos fill the bouquet, while the palate offers more pithy citrus and green melon characters. It's well-balanced, with vibrant acidity and a fresh wet-stone minerality that endures through the long finish. It's hard to resist now, but it will continue to mature and hold well through 2024."
"While initially offering more earth than fruit, this sprightly kabinett amasses bold white peach, grapefruit and gooseberry flavors as it opens and melds. Vivacious acidity and lingering undertones of crushed earth and clay lend structure and depth. Drinks well already but should improve through 2030."
"This barrel selection is still tight and tannic, with compact, yet substantial cranberry, raspberry and pie-cherry fruit. It's got muscle and depth, and opens up nicely with aeration, displaying ripe and polished tannins through a long finish."
"There's strong oak, vanilla and spice cake on the nose of this rich bottling from Paso Robles vineyards as well as sugar plums and wet soil aromas. There's an earthy minerality of turned loam to the palate, with hints of forest moss, pine oil and cracked pepper."
"Utilizing Pommard clones planted in 1990, this exceptional wine has a nose-tickling funky note, providing a rich composty accent to juice loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit. It's detailed and textural, a truly engaging wine which goes well beyond the fruit to add the sort of complexity not often found in this price range."
"Thick, firm tannin is pronounced in this reserve-level wine. Coconut and vanilla-seasoned oak rides along a roadway of dried herb, clove and blackberry as the texture softens and teases in complexity."
"This impressive single-quinta wine is packed with fruit and plenty of the firm tannins. Ripe, perfumed and with touches of sweetness, it will age well. Drink from 2027."
"With its north-facing aspect, this vineyard is just right for red wines rather than Port. A cool character comes through even in ageworthy wines such as this. Firm tannins mix in with the juicy red fruits and crisp aftertaste. Wood aging adds spice and rounds out the wine. Drink from 2021."
"Cool, intensely mineral tones of slate and river rock permeate from nose to finish. It's dry on the palate but elegantly fruity, offering notes of crisp stone fruit, tangerine and lime. Piercing acidity leads a long, thrilling finish. It's a lovely wine already but likely to show even better from 2019."
"Tasty, spicy oak nuances give a great lift to this frankly heavy, massively built wine that is very full bodied and has a thick layer of chewy tannins. Hints of toasted walnuts, cinnamon and nutmeg weave through dark chocolate, blackberry and espresso flavors that are concentrated and deep."
"Bright and forward on the nose, this leads with attractive scents of lemon custard, verbena and grilled pineapple. The palate is plush and round, yet not overdone, boasting lush flavors of toasted apple and citrus oil that linger on the close. Bright acidity keeps the weight in check and lends a mouthwatering sensation on the finish. Time will encourage added depth and complexity, so consider drinking 20202024."
"Again in 2015 this offers reserve-level density and extra complexity, with the added bonus that it's the winery's biggest production Pinot. Winemaker Tony Rynders loads it with appealing cinnamon, caramel and milk chocolate components from aging in half new French oak. This is all nicely integrated into a base of fresh raspberry fruit. Tasty and ready for near-term drinking."
"Dusty mineral tones juxtapose pristine lime and lemon in this zesty, steely wine. While dry and light footed, it has an expansive, juicy richness that's satisfying through a long finish."
"A little reserved at first, with time this opens up to reveal notes of pressed fynbos, dandelion, fresh straw, apple blossom and crushed mineral that grace the just-ripe apple and green-melon core. Surprisingly round and mouth-filling, that weight is countered by a stunningly vibrant seam of citrusy acidity and spiced tones of allspice and nutmeg. Final notes of grilled apple skin and pie crust dance on the lingering finish. Drink now2026."
"This is an intensely youthful blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Syrah, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Malbec. Concentrated flavors of black cherry, blackberry, cured meat and black licorice are well wrapped within a cocoon of toasted oak and firm tannins. Enjoy 20252030."
"Z'IVO's Pinot Blanc is an obscure clone called Gouges, after the Burgundy winery that first isolated it. It's exceptionally dense, textural and racy, with scents and mouthfeel close to Chablis, with the same underlying minerality. Oyster shells and sea-breeze accents come with tart melon fruit and a touch of lime zest."
"All Dijon clones from the Alloro vineyard, this tightly wound effort mixes tree-fruit flesh and skin flavors in a compact balanced wine with some good years of life ahead. There's a pleasing nuttiness resonating through the finish, from a small percentage that was fermented in new French oak. Give it an extra year or two in bottle and it should open up nicely."
"Blackberry, leather and plum aromas are inviting. This wine is full and lush on the palate, with grippy tannins. Oaky berry flavors are accented by spice and chocolate notes, while the finish brings pronounced coffee and mocha flavors. Drink through 2025."
"This reserve has the same detail and overall finesse as the regular estate bottling, but here there's an extra dollop of black fruits. Overall, the 12-barrel select is a bit bigger and fruitier, but much in the same style."
"Rich, ripe and downright succulent, this offers pinpoint fruit flavors of grapefruit, apple and melon, with a broad streak of vanilla cream. The length is a bit surprising, sneaking up as the wine breathes open. Though just 10% was aged in new barrels, there is a pleasing toasty frame around the finish."
"A must-get for those attracted to obscure grapes, this cool vintage bottling of a northern Italian variety by Marisa Beverly (assistant winemaker at Au Bon Climat, and Jim Clendenen's niece) shows cranberry, strawberry, dried plum, baked earth and sumac-cinnamon spice on the nose. The palate offers strong loamy minerality right away, then settles into dried sage, peppery spice and tangy but dense dark fruits."
"This wine, under the same ownership as Margaux estate Mongravey, is a well-structured blend with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon. The 100% new-wood aging gives the wine an intensely toasty, dry character at this young stage. But the great black-currant and berry fruit is developing as well. Drink this rich wine from 2024."
"Packed with black fruits and dense tannins, this is a rich wine with a fine future. This is full bodied and structured in feel, with a dry, spicy core of tannins. With its deep concentration, this wine will do well with time in the cellar. Drink from 2025."
"This is an impressively structured and balanced wine from Patrick Meynard. Rich black fruits are nourished by the spice and toast of wood aging for 14 to 18 months.Dense and juicy, this ripe wine likely will age well. Drink from 2024."
"Produced under the same management as Chteau Larose Trintaudon, this wine is rich, smoky and packed with blackberry fruits. Its warm, ripe character contrasts with the juicy fruitiness and firm backdrop of tannins, giving a wine with potential. Drink from 2024."
"This estate, based in the Gironde port village of Lamarque, has produced a richly textured, chocolate and bitter-cocoa-flavored wine. That is only a problem at the moment, because ripe black-currant fruits are developing under the structure to give density, concentration and a serious wine as it ages. Drink from 2021."
"Big, ripe and packed with tannins, this is a dense wine. The concentration is palpable, rich with black plum and berry fruits. This powerful wine with its great tannins and fruit needs to age. Drink from 2025."
"Generous in its ripe Merlot, this wine is sumptuous and full bodied. Although there are plenty of tannins, they give just the right structure to this wine. From a 74-acre property that is named after the small village of Pez, the wine is rich and will age well. Drink from 2025."
"A classic blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Colorino, this fragrant, almost ethereal wine is all about finesse. It opens with earthy aromas of woodland berry, tilled soil, truffle, violet and new leather while the elegant palate delivers succulent Marasca cherry, crushed strawberry and baking spice. Bright acidity and polished tannins provide balance and refined support. Drink through 2028."
"This is a whopper of a Pinot Noir, seen through the eyes of a Paso Robles winemaker. Dark and thick in the glass, it shows black cherry, clove and allspice on the nose. The massive palate offers blackberry and boysenberry flavors, with spicy gingersnap notes giving balance."
"This Grenache is a little older than the typical release, and that gives it some extra depth. Aromas of cranberry sauce, baking spice, rose petals, hibiscus and carnations are nose-tickling. The palate is loaded with spice cake, gingerbread and rounded, slightly sour red-cherry flavors, altogether soft and pleasing."
"Fragrant woodland berry, blue flower and cake spice aromas mingle with a balsamic menthol note. The concentrated but almost weightless palate offers juicy raspberry, fleshy black cherry, espresso and star anise alongside polished supple tannins."
"Smooth and showing primary bready flavors, this has a concentrated core of apple and quince, with plenty of barrel flavors. Roasted peanuts, lemon zest and a touch of salted caramel come up, but this young wine really needs another year or two in bottle to show its best."
"Zesty, aromatic notes of lemon and tangerine carry the nose. The palate then bursts forth with ripe citrus: tangerine, orange and mandarin. This off-dry version of Sylvaner may be unusual but it is a triumph of balance. The concentrated, zesty freshness of citrus is countered by the ripeness of the fruit on a very light, fresh, concentrated and compelling palate. This is intriguing and irresistible."
"Dominated by dark-colored, dense Alicante Bouschet, this is a rich wine. Its tannins are still up front, although watch for the rich black fruits as they develop. Aged in wood, it has vanilla and spice flavors that enhance the ripe fruit of the wine. Drink from 2019."
"This is a small-production wine from a former French soccer player. It is soft, with great fruit and a rounded texture. Generous while also dense, it's powered by firm tannins. Drink this ripe wine from 2025."
"This wine is all Cinsault from Olsen Vineyard. Aged in neutral French oak, it's resplendent with aromas of raspberry jam, potpourri, plum, flower and garrigue. The palate is transparent in style with elegant but rich red-fruit and plum flavors that lead to a lengthy, warm finish."

"This reserve has the same detail and overall finesse as the regular estate bottling, but here there's an extra dollop of black fruits. Overall, the 12-barrel select is a bit bigger and fruitier, but much in the same style."
"Rich, ripe and downright succulent, this offers pinpoint fruit flavors of grapefruit, apple and melon, with a broad streak of vanilla cream. The length is a bit surprising, sneaking up as the wine breathes open. Though just 10% was aged in new barrels, there is a pleasing toasty frame around the finish."
"A must-get for those attracted to obscure grapes, this cool vintage bottling of a northern Italian variety by Marisa Beverly (assistant winemaker at Au Bon Climat, and Jim Clendenen's niece) shows cranberry, strawberry, dried plum, baked earth and sumac-cinnamon spice on the nose. The palate offers strong loamy minerality right away, then settles into dried sage, peppery spice and tangy but dense dark fruits."
"This wine, under the same ownership as Margaux estate Mongravey, is a well-structured blend with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon. The 100% new-wood aging gives the wine an intensely toasty, dry character at this young stage. But the great black-currant and berry fruit is developing as well. Drink this rich wine from 2024."

"This estate, based in the Gironde port village of Lamarque, has produced a richly textured, chocolate and bitter-cocoa-flavored wine. That is only a problem at the moment, because ripe black-currant fruits are developing under the structure to give density, concentration and a serious wine as it ages. Drink from 2021."

"This wine comes from an historic 700-acre estate in the southern Mdoc that's home to vines, forests and stallions. The wine is ripe and full of black currants from its majority of Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and packed with generous fruit, the wine shows the progress the property has made in recent years. It still holds plenty of tannins, so age further and drink from 2023."
"The estate recalls the Pontac family, once one of the largest landowners in Bordeaux, who built this grand 16th-century hunting lodge. Today's wine is well balanced with ripe tannins, juicy red fruits and acidity. The 60% Merlot gives a full, generous character, although the tannins need time to soften. Drink from 2024."
"This is a supple and sexy version of a notoriously tannic wine. It has a deep dark color, enticing dark chocolate and blackberry aromas and a thick layer of berries and black cherries on the palate. Tightly meshed tannins give it plenty of pucker power, and mean that this wine can age for quite a while. Best from 2020 to 2025."
"Clean aromas of cinnamon, dried rose petals and tight raspberry fruit make for a very pretty nose on this lighter delicate style of Grenache. The palate is quite fresh, with cherry, cranberry, orange rind, dried ginger, cracker pepper and sumac flavorings combining for a very refreshing, elegant bottling."

A stunner now, this will continue to evolve and mature well through 2022."

"This wine sees 40% French oak and is a reserve-level barrel selection. Soft and smooth, the pretty berry and plum fruit has a touch of mocha, but not too much. It's had ample bottle time to be ready to enjoy immediately."
"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, the aromas pop, with notes of boysenberry, bacon fat, orange peel, herb and spice. The palate is dense and rich, packed with ultraripe blue- and black-fruit flavors. It delivers a lot of hedonistic appeal. For those looking for a big, bold, warm vintage Syrah, this one's for you."
"This wine is delightfully fruit-forward in cherry cola and strawberry jam, balancing the strong well-defined flavors against a backdrop of powerful tannin and oak."

"The Latchkey vineyard is shared with Cody Wright (of Purple Hands). Spicy cranberry, strawberry and raspberry fruit shines here, young and fresh and vibrant. It's snappy and sappy, with good grip and supporting acidity. It should drink best in the early 2020s."
"There's a dusty character to the tannins, which complement the tart pomegranate and raspberry fruit. It's already quite smooth, lightly toasty and finished with a dollop of cinnamon."
"This shows power and richness with a bit of finesse as well. Accompanying a deep, dark hue are equally dense aromas of black cherry and blackberry, cola, cocoa and a hint of dried herbs. The palate comes with chewy tannins and more plush fruit, but this well-structured wine should come into its own with great dignity soon enough. Drink 20202032."

Trademark pencil lead, eucalyptus and red currant characters mingle with dried flowers, herbs and furniture polish. The tannins are dusty and tight-grained, with an herbaceous currant flavor continuing throughout. Drink now2032."
"This wine from Matchbook has been improving steadily over recent vintages and now it's taken a big step toward more finesse and less flash. A very soothing mouthfeel and generous, but not overt, flavors make a great combination in this creamy, yummy and full-bodied wine. It has everything from toasty oak and lemon curd to mild marzipan nuances that interlace with good acidity for a balanced palate and a lingering finish."
"Tinta Negra is a hybrid grape that takes on the characteristics of other Madeira grapes. To taste, this oak-aged wine could almost be a Bual. Smooth and rich, it has a sweet toffee and caramel character to go alongside the intense acidity. Drink now."
"Delicately wood aged, this wine is beautifully structured and balanced. Ripe apple and quince fruits are cut with acidity and a clean, clear minerality. The wine needs to age for a while and will be ready to drink from 2019."
"Black fruits dominate this full-bodied block selection. The alcohol is pulled back a half step from the previous vintage, and there's a pleasing minerality to the foundation. A hint of caraway comes up as it winds down through the chocolatey finish."
"Blue flower, Asian spice and wild berry aromas mingle with a whiff of espresso. The rounded generous palate offers baked plum, fleshy blackberry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside supple tannins. Drink through 2023."
"Seriously wood aged, this reserva is meant to be matured over several years. Firm tannins, rich black fruits and concentration provide the aging potential. It's a rich, dense wine, still with its dry core. Give this ripe wine until 2020."
"While the nose is intensely honeyed and floral, there's a steely mineral intensity on the palate of this elegant, dry Riesling. Pristine white grapefruit, lime and gooseberry flavors are invigorating and tart but fall on the palate in creamy, expansive layers. It's an impeccably balanced wine with a long, honed finish."
"Hints of smoke and pencil shavings accent fragrant cherry blossom and pink grapefruit notes in this feather-light kabinett. It's a juicy, unctuously fruity wine but structured keenly by laser-light acidity and earthy nuances that linger long on the finish."
"Named after the Son of Apulia, Frederick II of Swabiathe 13th century Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire who made his summer home the Castel del Monte, for which the DOCG is now namedthis is a pure expression of the Nero di Troia variety. Aromas of dark cherries, spiced bramble berries, old leather and anise permeate the nose and carry through to a tightly woven, grippy palate. There's wonderful tension, depth and complexity to this medium-bodied wine which needs a few years to soften its tannic edge. Drink from 2020."
"Plumes of ripe peach, apricot and mango are exuberant on the nose, while the fruit profile on the palate is markedly demure, offering crisp but penetrating hits of gooseberry, green plum and lime. It's taut and nervous on the palate, with a firm mineral undertone. While elegant already, this should meld its fruit and mineral intensities after a few years in the cellar. Hold till 2019."
"It's at least the third excellent vintage in a row from Ruby Hill, which is a historic name in Livermore Valley. Rich, concentrated and oaky, this is a no-holds-barred wine that layers toasted, smoky, spicy aromas overripe pear and nutmeg flavors. The body is full and the texture is mouth-filling."
"Deeply concentrated lemon and pineapple meld seamlessly into earthier complexities of crushed earth and flint in this vivacious sptlese. It's deft and dancing on the palate, with a piercing honey-struck finish. Drinks well already but should improve further through 2025."
"A rich style of Paso Cab, this bottling starts with aromas of rich black-cherry cream, vanilla, nutmeg, gravel and cinnamon. The palate is full of caramel, French toast and kirsch flavors at first, but then the chalky, still somewhat stiff tannins add a mouth-coating texture."
"Toasty dark-fruit aromas are compact. In the mouth, this wine is more screechy, tannic and taut. Oaky and berry flavors are balanced and integrated on a long finish with driving acidity. Drink this strong-boned Tempranillo from a lesser vintage through 2028."
"Lilacs and plump blackberry fruit meet with dried sage, fennel and a hint of green peppercorn on the lively fresh nose of this bottling by second generation vintner Drake Whitcraft. The palate is peppery, fresh and light, with cracked black pepper, rounded purple fruits and a strong acidity proving easy to quaff."
"This full-bodied wine makes no apologies for its assertive oaky profile and matches the power of the smoky spicy elements deftly with ripe pear and hazelnut flavors. It has excellent concentration and a sense of layering, plus a long, delicious finish."
"Focused and elegantly structured, this sparkling blend has enticing scents of orchard fruit, citrus and brioche. The vibrant, precise palate evokes white cherry, peach and tangerine zest framed in bright acidity and a refined lively mousse. A mineral note closes the dry finish."
"A fifty-fifty blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, this opens with enticing scents of brioche, white stone fruit, citrus and red berry. Mirroring the nose, the vibrant palate offers tart sour cherry, pomegranate, bread dough and tangerine zest alongside a refined perlage and tangy acidity. A bitter almond note marks the close."
"Berry, apple and pastry aromas delicately swirl in the glass while the vibrant palate offers white peach, tangy tangerine zest and white cherry. An elegant, persistent perlage and bright acidity provide elegance and energy while a ginger note wraps around the finish."
"There's a pleasant earthy, spicy character right off the bat on the nose of this wine, opening with pronounced scents of Dr. Pepper, cherry cola, red plum, chicory root and church incense. The medium-weight palate offers structured tannins that lend surprising grip, yet bright acidity keeps the mouthfeel lifted. The stalky, tight red-berry flavors on the palate return to spicy abundance on the medium-length finish. Drink 20202025."
"This juicy bottle bursts open with pomegranate, cherry and orange zest. Hints of Dr. Pepper streak through, but overall it's an elegant and detailed wine, showing more finesse than sheer power."
"A shift from the 2005, this is one-third Pinot Noir and two-thirds Chardonnay, disgorged in July of 2017. It's tasty and surprisingly young, with tart apple and peach flavors dominant, along with light custard and some lovely toast. This may be enjoyed now or cellared for up to five years."
"A blend of 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay, this vibrant sparkler offers fresh aromas of red berry and citrus. On the palate, a lively perlage underscores pomegranate, red grapefruit and a hint of baking spice. It's well balanced, with crisp acidity."
"Exuberantly blossomy, this perfumed kabinett offers loads of pristine white peach and pineapple flavors off set by layers of cool minerals. It's a juicy yet revitalizing wine, with a long crystalline finish."
"Initially this wine is charred and smoky-smelling, with accents of graphite and cola. A tight, juicy palate is bolstered by bold core acidity, while ripe blackberry and currant flavors capture both the black and red sides of the flavor spectrum. A dry, tannic finish with peppery flavors is intense. Drink through 2026."
"It's rare to find a Portuguese white wine this old still available. While it does taste mature, it has wonderful nutty flavors and acidity, giving an old gold, yeasty character. This is a food wine, with its structure and mineral aftertaste. Drink now."
"Spicy, structured and with a smoky character, this rich wine will develop power. It has a dense texture, layers of tannins that are integrating with the blackberry fruits. This will be a good wine as it matures. Drink from 2024."
"This rich, juicy wine has 90% Merlot in the blend giving it vibrancy, rich tannins and great black-plum and spice flavors. It is a ripe wine, powerful and dense with intense youthful acidity that will soften. Drink this balanced, firm wine from 2022."
"Made with 100% Pinot Nero, this offers inviting aromas of cherry, acacia, bread dough and a whiff of hazelnut. On the bright structured palate, fresh acidity lifts toasted nut, brioche and pomegranate alongside a lively refined perlage."
"The nose on this ultimately zesty wine starts off on the richer side, with baked apple, yellow melon, cherimoya and orange peel. On the palate, the acidity is immediate and tremendously persistent, with flavors of apple blossom, pear syrup and tangerine spray riding the chalky texture."
"Enticing, fruity aromas of red cherry and brambly berry set the stage for layers of cola, baking spice and cocoa. The medium-weight palate offers a texture like crushed satin, smooth yet defined, with ample acidity to keep the structure and ripe-fruit flavors from feeling overly dense. The spice returns on the finish and continues alongside a hint of peppery warmth. Drink now2023."
"Sourced from a vineyard on the western edge of the valley, this sports lovely aromatics introducing matching flavors of black cherry and a dash of pepper. There's a pleasing minerality, like a lick of granite, and a whiff of dried thyme also."
"A blend of 29% Roussanne, 23% Chardonnay, 22% Chenin Blanc, 18% Grenache Blanc and 8% Viognier, this opens with delicate aromas of pink apple, orange blossom, strawberry hull and white melon. The medium-weight palate offers just enough fruity weight to ground the precise cut of the vibrant acidity. Harmonious and well-balanced, this is one to enjoy now2022."
"There is a slight hint of lime zest and fern on the nose. The palate is more expressive but in a slender, subtle way, offering a lime zest flavor countered by white pepper and a streak of green fern. Citrus freshness tingles everywhere and even has a pithy, textural element to it."
"Dusty mineral and zesty lime aromas are contrasted by plump, summer-sweet peach and tangerine on the palate. It's a spry, frisky kabinett, with lip-smacking sweetness balanced neatly by streaks of spine tingling acidity."
"There's a buzz of electric acidity that hits the midpalate here, softened by tones of luscious peach, pineapple and guava. It's delicate and thrilling on the palate but lavishly floral and fruity through a long, reverberating finish."
"Fruit for this wine comes from the state's original Syrah vineyard. Expressive aromas of dried herb, dark raspberry, huckleberry, spice and licorice lead to ripe, full fruit flavors that glide on the finish. It's not shy, bringing a lot of richness and appeal."
"Intensely earthen tones of smoke and slate abound in this profoundly mineral sptlese. The midpalate brings forth sweeter, sunnier tones of fresh lemon and lime, along with a pleasantly bracing astringency that lends structure to the finish. It's a savory but complex sptlese that needs time to meld. Hold till at least 2020 but its likely to improve for at least a decade beyond that."
"Just a handful of Oregon wineries produce this varietal wine, and one hopes more will follow. Fresh, leesy and rich, with mineral-soaked flavors, this broadens out in the mouth with apple-flavored fruit. There's an appealing note of toasted cracker, peanut shells and a whiff of sea breeze. It's a fascinating wine."
"A delicious bottle of Pinot Gris from Iris is as certain as a sunrise. This lightly tawny wine brings scents of lemon oil, white flowers and lemon verbena. The lovely fruit pulls in apple, pear, kiwi and a touch of banana, all in perfect balance. In short, this is a thoroughly engaging and versatile white wine."
"This exceptional site was planted back in the 1970s, and winemaker Jay Somers pulls some of that old-vine depth and nuance out of his first release from Medici. Bursting with ripe cherry fruit, it's got a base of clean earth, with highlights of coffee grinds and dark chocolate."
"This is tight and reserved at first, needing time to open and reveal notes of green apple, lemon-lime citrus, yellow plum and underripe mango. Given those tight, bright aromas, it's surprising to encounter the medium-weight, round mouthfeel, with low acidity and ripe tones of guava and white grapefruit that carry through to the close."
"This remains tightly wound, but the deep flavors of black cherry and cassis suggest that once it unwraps it will add muscle and mass. Highlights of coffee and charred wood lead into an astringent finish with drying tannins."
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of oak, coconut, forest floor and plum cake that carry over to the chewy palate along with juicy black cherry, mocha and vanilla. Soft rounded tannins provide supple support."

There is concentration and depth of pear and apple flavors. The finish is just off dry but full of that glorious fruit."
"There's a lot to like about this refreshing, savory sparkler. It opens with inviting aromas of baked bread, baking spice, white stone fruit and a whiff of lemon pastry cream. The vibrant elegant palate delivers ripe Gala apple, white peach, candied tangerine drop and hazelnut alongside tangy acidity. A lively perlage provides the backdrop."
"This tightly wound, still very young bottling from Rick Longoria's estate vineyard needs a little time to open up, but when it does, there are grapefruit pith, candied lemon rind and freeze-dried honeydew aromas to enjoy. The texture is tremendously chalky, delivering flavors of lime skin, apple rind and orange candies."
"This wine shows a heady, toasty nose of black-fruit aromas, along with maple, spice and heat notes. Spiced blackberry and cassis flavors are typical of this Tinta de Toro, however a palate that's rough as sandpaper makes this a tough go. Drink through 2025."
"Smooth and toasty, this cuve pushes pretty barrel flavors front and center, well-defined and framing crisp fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. There's a dash of orange marmalade that seals the finish. The wine spent 16 months in barrel, 40% new and 60% once-used."
"This medium-bodied Pinot offers aromas of tree bark, vanilla, dried leaves, cherry cola and a hint of licorice. The palate is supersmooth, with silky tannins and a tart cherry finish."
"A blend of 51% Petit Verdot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Carmenre, this opens with floral tones of crushed violets and carnation alongside brambly berry, chocolate-covered cherry and sweet spice. The plush, velvety palate showcases a solid tannic structure and a fruity berry-preserve flavor, while final notes of tree bark, wood spice and cocoa powder linger long on the close. Drink now2023."
"Lightly wood aged, this ripe wine was fermented initially in open tanks, giving the wine its rich black-fruit character and open texture. Spice from wood aging mixes with generous fruits to make a richly textured wine that will be ready to drink from 2019."
"This is a ripe wine full of broad black fruits. Smoothed by the wood aging and with plenty of acidity to balance, it is rich and structured. The tannins in this wine from the de la Rosa estate are already enmeshed in the fruit. This wine could be drunk now for its fruit, although it will be better from 2019."
"This is a well-balanced and attractive pour, with scents of orange blossom, lemon verbena, quinine and lime that frame the just-ripe peach and melon fruit core. A pithy astringency provides a subtle texture to the palate and lends some lingering grip to the finish, coupled with a vibrant acidity that leaves you read for more. Drink now2022."
"While subdued on the nose, there's a deep concentration of sweet-tart tangerine and grapefruit flavors on the palate of this lushly textured Riesling. It's bold in mouthfeel for a kabinett but zesty acidity and a flinty mineral undertone keeps it invigorating."
"Subdued red apple and lemon on the nose ripen into sweeter, honeyed tones of mango, peach and nectarine on the palate. Surprisingly lavish and deeply concentrated, it's an unctuously fruity yet elegantly balanced wine, with a vivacious lemon-lime finish."
"Scintillating acidity highlights crisp yellow peach and apple in this racy, light-footed kabinett. It's a delicately honeyed but penetrating wine that's approachable now but concentrated enough to hold well through 2025."
"Reflecting a warm, dry vintage, this wine smells ripe and balsamic, with notes of cheese blending with raw wood, cowhide, coconut and cassis aromas. A bipolar palate features creamy oak and lemony acidity. Deep berry-fruit flavors are pushed by perky acidity towards a finish with toast and chocolate notes. Drink from 20192030."
"A blend of 70% Nero di Troia and 30% Montepulciano, this is an enticingly savory and earthy wine with lots of appeal. Aromas of spiced red cherry, cured meat, peppery tobacco and anise meld seamlessly on the nose. The aromas are echoed on the mouthwatering and engaging palate of medium weight, lingering on a sanguine note. Currently grippy and structured with grainy tannins, this will soften with time in bottle, giving way to its wealth of complexities. Enjoy from 2020."
"Here's a savory red with surprising depth for the cool wet vintage. Dark wild cherry, licorice, violet, juicy plum, tilled earth and truffle aromas all follow through to the buffed palate. Fresh acidity and supple polished tannins lend brightness and give it a smooth, rounded texture."
"Red berry, bread dough and toasted nut aromas emerge on this elegant, structured sparkler. On the palate, bright acidity underscores Rennet apple, pomegranate and nectarine alongside a refined perlage."
"A gorgeous bouquet of apple skin, grilled pineapple, beeswax and a touch of baking spice sets the stage in this easy-to-like wine. The medium-weight body offers a superb balance of richness and freshness, with ripe, spicy fruit tones that harmonize with bright, lingering acidity, resulting in a fine overall texture. Drink now2021."
"Pommard and Wdenswil are the clones, and the wine spent 18 months in roughly two-thirds new French oak. It's luscious and loaded with blueberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, gliding into a finish with moderate tannins, a whiff of coffee and a streak of caramel."
"Earthy plum and berry aromas open this firm gran reserva from a cold vintage. This wine is chunky on the palate, with scraping tannins. Rooty, meaty berry and cinnamon flavors are slightly stewed, while this is long but hollow on the finish. Drink through 2026."
"While sunny tangerine and yellow peach flavors abound, deeply embedded layers of smoke, struck flint, fennel and pollen lend savory complexities to this kabinett. It's luscious yet spry, with racy streaks of acidity and a lingering, spicy finish. Drinks well already but should improve through 2025."
"The debut of Napa native winemaker and entrepreneur Josh Phelps' own label, this is a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Malbec, 7% Cabernet Franc, 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. It delivers tremendous value for the quality, a mix of chocolate-covered cherry, blueberry and vanilla cola wrapped in smooth, seductive layers of robust elegance. Tobacco, pencil shavings and cigar box add alluring seasoning."
"Spicy bramble berry aromas are lifted and pure on the nose of this wine, riding over an earthy core of pressed violets and Mediterranean scrub. There's energy to the moderately full palate, with vibrant acidity cutting through juicy red and black berry flavors. Orange rind and tense granite tones provide further intrigue, with soft, integrated tannins giving structure."
"This unique blend of 44% Mourvdre, 33% Zinfandel, 20% Grenache and 3% Counoise starts with dried alpine strawberry, pomegranate, wild chaparral spice, crushed pepper and bay leaf on the elegantly woven nose. A strong sagebrush character ensues on the palate, giving nuance to the saucy plum fruit. The acidity and tannins are well primed and ready to drink."
"This blend of 42% Carignan, 29% Cinsault and 29% Grenache is full and concentrated, but not overly done. There's a mentholated and slightly liquorous edge to the ripe black plum, cherry and boysenberry fruit, as well as subtle hints of cocoa powder and pressed violets. Medium weight, the texture is like crushed velvet, with structure and finesse to frame the fruity palate. Final notes of charred sweet spice, black pepper and tea grace the lingering finish. Drink now2022."
"Toasty lemon peel and spiced orange rind set up a spicy, citrusy welcome on the nose of this wine. At the core are rich notes of lemon custard, pear flesh and melon, all cut by superb acidity and a fresh, steely minerality. It's driven and focused, with clear precision on the palate and a medium-length finish that evolves from fruit flesh to rind and finally a kiss of earthy spice. Drink now2022."
"This wine offers aromas of scorched earth, pipe tobacco, mature black-skinned berry and a hint of leather. The rounded, generous palate doles out juicy black cherry, fleshy raspberry, star anise and a hint of cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
"A tiny production of lightly oaked wine from primarily Pommard clones, this wine presents as thick and tannic at first, with a touch of reduction. Its intensity and density mellow in the glass to show a greater sense of elegance and fresh acid-driven flavor, built around pomegranate, strawberry and wild lavender."
"White flower, yellow orchard fruit and brioche aromas carry through to the elegantly sparkling palate together with yellow apple, white peach and tangerine zest. Tangy acidity lifts the rich flavors while a creamy mousse gives it a silky texture."
"Aromas of black plum and coffee bean set the scene for flavors of blackberry and black cherry that are quickly joined by stronger flavors of smoked meat and espresso bean. Rich tannins coat the mouth, receding into a smoke-filled finish."
"Drenched with melted butter and vanilla flavors, but not blatantly oaky, this full-bodied Chardonnay is so lush that it's almost sweet. It seems to expand on the palate, brimming with delicious Fuji apple and Bosc pear notes that don't quit but last through a lingering finish."
"Clear varietal character comes out in this wine, with solid black-cherry fruit and highlights of licorice, espresso, vanilla and black tea. The concentration and balance are impressive, and it lingers with a late show of power. This winery does far better with its red wines than its whites."
"A solid effort, this brings plum and blueberry, black cherry and baking spices together in a substantial, even muscular style. Earthy tannins form a strong base, and the overall sturdy character, along with the balance and texture, suggest that this will age nicely over the next decade. Drink now through the late 2020s."
"Fresh pressed boysenberry, fennel bulb, white pepper dust and Italian herbs show on the nose of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Syrah and 25% Zinfandel. The leathery tannins grab hold of the palate rather quickly, and still need some time to smooth out, yet provide solid structure from which to hang the black plum and mulberry flavors."
"The particulars of this estate-grown blend change annually, but it remains smooth and deeply-fruited, a tasty riot of loganberries, marionberries, blackberries and more. Juicy and fresh, with spot-on tannins, it's flat-out delicious and a stunning value."
"The top selection of the 2015 vintage, this estate-grown wine has a lovely mix of strawberries, raspberries and plums. Tangy citrus brightens the acids, and a dusting of cocoa amplifies the finish."
"The Nicholas reserve sees 40% new French oak yet isn't at all oaky. Rather, it's fruit-powered, smooth and supple. Blue plum and black cherry come with pastry spices and a dash of sassafras."

"Intriguing aromas of boysenberry syrup, plum, sweet herb and barrel spice lead to exquisitely balanced, somewhat elegantly styled fruit and savory flavors. It's a very understated, very pretty expression of this warm vintage and growing region."
"Earthy plum and cherry aromas are typical of Rioja gran reserva. A full, grabby palate is not silky-smooth, while this wine tastes of fig and chocolaty berry fruits that are on the cusp of cooked. It loses steam on a finish with raisiny notes. Drink through 2022."
"Heady aromas suggesting grilled herb, sea breeze, wild berry and eucalyptus lead the nose. Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot, the tightly knit palate offers dried black cherry, red currant, white pepper and star anise framed in taut, fine-grained tannins."
"Under the same management as Chteau la Dominique in Saint-milion, this wine, dominated by ripe Merlot, is full, open and developing quickly. There's a rich edge to the black fruits as well as some powerful tannins that will need to soften. It is an open, generous wine, full of fruit and richly structured. Drink from 2023."
"Dating to before the French Revolution, this estate produces some rich, generous wines. This vintage is in that mold, with its rounded black fruits, crisp acidity and solid core of dry tannins. The structure will allow the wine to age, giving great potential. Drink from 2024."
"Under the same ownership as Chteau Cissac, this ancient estate, dating to the 6th century, is producing some fine wines. This rich vintage is well structured, dense and with classic black-currant Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. Ripe Merlot adds its rich jamminess to a wine that is still young. Drink from 2024."
"With over 80% Cabernet Sauvignon in the this Kopp family blend, this wine is packed with black currants, ripe tannins and a smoky backdrop from the wood aging. It is structured, dry and juicy at the same time. With this firm core, the wine will need aging, so drink from 2024."

"Just to the north of Saint-Estphe, this 44-acre estate regularly produces good, structured wines. In this vintage, the structure is right there along with layers of rich blackberry fruits. This is a solid, dense wine, ripe and ready to age well. Drink from 2023."
"Rich black cherry, clove, gingerbread and nose-tickling Christmas spices show on the rich nose of this appellation blend. It's also rich on the tip of the sip, with dried black cherry and more clove, but there is a black plum skin tang that holds it in check."
Bright and focused raspberry fruit comes buttressed by a firm streak of Mediterranean herbs. Hints of iron thread through the finish. This is a taut substantial wine that will require some breathing time to show its best.
"This lush and lovely wine, a New World version of Muscadet, is tangy and loaded with bright apple and pear flavors. Amplified by hints of citrus rind, it opens up even further once it warms in the glass, showing unexpected and quite impressive depth and detail."
"A very gentle touch of summer blossom is joined by fresh, bright lemon on the nose. The palate has a creamy element that enriches the bright lemon palate without adding heaviness. This is sprightly and light, but also creamy and mellow. A dry, fresh and totally convincing wine with a clean, long finish."
"Aromas of baking spice, blackberry and cherry draw you into the glass. The palate is chock full of cherry and dark-chocolate flavors, with the tannins giving a light squeeze."
"The aromas pop, with notes of clarified butter, pineapple, candlewax, corn silk, apricot and mango. The palate is full of stone and tropical fruit flavors that bring a big yum factor. Aromas and flavors are ripe, like the vintage this wine comes from."
"This is a velvety thick, delightfully lush and seductive wine, savory in pine forest and clove, with layered highlights of orange peel, cinnamon and black tea. Dark cherry cobbler provides rich flavor that remains balanced in the glass."
"Plump with ripe black-plum and cherry flavors, this single-vineyard wine offers a greater density of fruit than the producer's entry-level Pinot Noir. Still, it shares a ghostly elegance marked by faded whiffs of dried violet and lavender, dusty spice-box and earth notes. Vibrant acidity lends finesse to the palate along with a meandering finish of fine grained, bitter tannins."

Excellent concentration and pinpoint focus are hallmarks at this property. Tart cranberry and raspberry fruit comes with a streak of dark chocolate and polished tannins. The focus and detail are exceptional.
"Shades of subtle oak, fig and lemongrass are framed by tightly wound acidity on the palate. Light in feel, this is a bright, exotic Chardonnay with loads of energy."
"A gentle mix of red berry, red plum and cherry carries some of the lightly earthy tones of the AVA. Soft and accessible, there's a hint of Dr. Pepper running through the flavors also. It's drinking right about at its prime and should hold through the early 2020s."
"Here is a tasty chewy full-flavored effort, loaded with black-cherry fruit. There are notes of cola and brown sugar, along with a finishing hint of coffee. It was aged for 11 months in just 7% new French oak."
"This showcases a nice balance between ripe-fruit notes, toasty warmth and ample acidity. Aromas of lemon custard, creamed pear and baked apple set the stage, framed by scents of toasted walnuts and clover honey.

"It's no surprise that this appropriately named blend of 76% Petite Sirah, 20% Tannat and 4% Petit Verdot is dense and dark, starting with aromas of crushed asphalt, elderberry jam, white pepper and baked goods. The palate is equally unctuous, showing concentrated purple flowers, tar, more elderberry and a judicious hint of wild mints."
"This wine exhibits superb interplay between just-ripe fruit character and earthy, spicy tones. Notes of tree bark, fresh turned soil, cocoa nib and olive mingle harmoniously with fruity tones of black cherry and plum. A sanguine accent dances across the silky, medium-bodied palate, while a peppery kick unfolds on the lingering close. Drink now2023."
"Dirk Niepoort's venture into the Bairrada region at Quinta de Baixo blossoms in this wine. Rich fruit gives the wine both firm tannins and a ripe, crisply textured character. It is balanced with acidity, full of juicy fruit and perfumed with mint. Drink this wine from 2019."
"Toast, underbrush, tobacco leaf and cassis aromas lead the nose. Reflecting the cool wet vintage, the palate is austere and lighter bodied than usual but still elegant, offering raw cherry, pomegranate, licorice and ground pepper alongside tight close-grained tannins. Give the tannins several more years to unwind."
"Two clones and two vineyards combine here, with 18 months in French oak pulling it all together. It's a tasty mix of fruit, spice and barrel, with pomegranate and red-plum flavors at the core. Baking spices suggest buttered cinnamon toast, with a touch of cocoa powder adding the coup de grce."
"This vineyard emphasizes rather steely mineral-driven flavors. The fruit is ripened in an austere mode, firm and sculpted, with flavors of wild mountain berry. A whiff of tobacco follows through, with a similar vein in the finish. It's a dense wine that will reward aggressive decanting."
"Savory tones of smoke and crushed earth permeate from nose to finish, suggesting a complex auslese that's more mineral than fruit. Still, vibrant lemon-lime acidity and silken streaks of honey penetrate the midpalate and extend through a long, invigorating finish. It drinks well now but should show even better from 2021."

Cocoa is a prime flavor on the finish. Drink now through 2023."
"Veteran vintners Bruno D'Alfonso and Kris Curran manage to tease out uniquely fresh aromas and flavors from this Syrah, starting with the nose, which is full of cola, root beer, beet juice and Mission fig scents. The medium-bodied palate shows lots of flowery purple fruit and candied purple-fruit flavors, with a hint of licorice spice."
"An abundance of spicy smoky oak aromas meets equally abundant flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa and raspberry in this full-bodied and heavily tannic wine. The color is about as dark as it gets, the mouthfeel is massive and yet the flavors are so big they balance out the huge structure. That it was aged for 30 months in 80% new French barrels explains the alluring spiciness."
"From one of the state's top Syrah vineyards, this offers aromas of dried and fresh herb, violet and black cherry that lead to full-bodied, extremely pure dark-fruit flavors. Aged in three- to five-year old-oak, it has a purity and mouthfeel that add to the appeal. It should show well on the dinner table."
"Plump yellow cherry, peach and apricot abound in this juicy, deeply concentrated kabinett. It's an intensely sun-kissed, almost tropical wine but light as a feather on the palate and deftly balanced by spine tingling acidity."
"While smoky and earthen on the nose, the palate of this light-footed auslese is plush, almost fleshy, with unctuous yellow-peach, mango and tangerine flavors. Racy lime acidity revitalizes the midpalate, leading to a long, clean finish. Drink now through 2025."
"This is an expressive yet well-balanced wine, with wonderful interplay between the dense black-fruit characteristics. Brambly boysenberry, blackberry and cherry meld seamlessly with notes of sweet spice, purple violets, game and white pepper. The palate's slightly creamy texture is countered by framing tannins that lend grip and structure through the finish. Drink now2023."
"Named after the latin name of the Ionian sea (Jonio), this single-variety Negroamaro has a dense, permeating nose of jammy red and black berries, tobacco leaf, crushed cocoa nibs and graphite. Firmly medium in weight, the palate shows a vibrant force of tart berries and game that turns richer and riper come the midpalate, translating as a lingering red cherry note on the finish. Sandy tannins offer plenty of grip, yet the bright acidity and pervasive fruit tones keep everything in check."
"Made primarily with Vermentino, this opens with delicate scents of white spring flower, yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of honey. Mirroring the nose, the fresh enveloping palate doles out dried apricot, juicy nectarine drop and a honeyed mineral note alongside tangy acidity. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2021."
"Plum, sweet cinnamon and cardamom are gracefully threaded through the core of brambly berry fruit. Aged for 11 months in barrel, it finishes with a streak of vanilla."

"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Klipsun (60%) and Dioynsus. Baking spice, herb, cocoa, tobacco, espresso and cherry aromas lead to suave, silky cherry and cocoa flavors. Like the vintage it came from, it holds nothing back. The oak (65% new French) is a bit up front at present but should integrate with additional time in bottle. Best after 2020."
"The vanilla and wood scent of new oak is evident on the nose. On the palate this is more integrated, the fine wood notes intertwining with the ripe cherry fruit. The tannin structure is fine and firm, supported by vivid freshness. This is lovely now but will mellow over the coming years. Drink 20182025."
"Plump aromas of poached pear, Meyer lemon pith, honeysuckle and an underlying slate-like minerality hit the nose on this bottling. There's a roundness to the palate of Asian pear, but the sip is all about grippy texture and sizzling citrus energy that carries deep into the finish."
"This is a well-made version of the variety, 100% in this case. Earthy tobacco, clove and dusty oak ride along seamless tannin structure and plenty of length and breadth. Balanced within a full-bodied sense of powerful weight and presence, it softens on the finish to reveal lighter touches of pencil shavings and clove."
"A rich and toasty wine, this opens with abundant aromas of baked apple, honey-roasted nuts, lemon oil and ginger-clove orange peel. The medium-weight palate is round and mouthfilling, but with superb acidity to balance, lifting the ripe fruit flavors and lending a saline lift to the finish. Drink this well-balanced beauty now2024."
"This opens with aromas of woodland berry, alpine herb, menthol and whiffs of oak-driven spice. The elegant precise palate delivers sour cherry, cranberry, star anise and a hint of salty mineral set against a backbone of fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. It's still youthfully austere and needs time to fully develop. Drink 20212031."

"Perfumed lavender opens the way to a softly layered, structured wine that's medium bodied and restrained in tone. Cassis and red cherry are matched by bright, lingering acidity that provides a welcome succulence throughout."
"A typical yet classy example of Margaret River, this wine dishes up notes of dark cherry, currant, tobacco, mocha, eucalyptus and dried green herbs.

It's elegant and soft enough to drink now but will age well through 2028."
"Quite pronounced in tropical fruit and floral aromas, this opens with attractive scents of pressed buttercup, honeysuckle and lime lead that frame the guava, pineapple rind and red apple fruit core. Those ripe-fruit tones carry through to the medium-weight palate, with bright, orange-laced acidity to lift. A final note of delicate sweet spice on the way back of the close. Drink now2022."
"This red embraces its main variety's ancestral home, blending in 12% Syrah, 10% Grenache and a pinch of other Rhne reds. Peppery and tannic, it shines in blueberry, cedar, dried herb and cinnamon, begging for more time in the bottle. Enjoy best 2019 through 2029."
"Lemon butter and plump pineapple aromas are cut by crushed gravel and an edgy citrus peel character on the nose of this blend of 55% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 17% Picpoul Blanc. The Roussanne provides a rich midpalate, full of fleshy but not overripe baked apple flavors, dusted with baking spice and leveled by buoyant acidity."

"This small-production wine (just 22 cases) is a blend of 53% Malbec, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot that spent 32 months in 35% new French oak.

It's soft on the palate and chalky in texture, boasting a butterscotch finish."

"Rounded and ripe aromas of baked strawberry, red plum, dried rose petal and anise show on the nose of this bottling by theater tech-turned-winemaker Sabrine Rodems. The complex texture is still a bit stiff and sticky on the palate, and the flavors are strong and straightforward, with cranberry and sandalwood. It's clean and refreshing overall, but it could use more time."
"This Chenin Blanc-based wine, with 14% Smillon, is complex, layered and evolving, expressing different waves of flavor and texture with each sip. Initial scents of lanolin and waxy pink apple transition into earthy notes of dried yellow flowers and grass, while the medium-weight palate evokes tart, refreshing flavors of lime leaf, lemon peel and white melon rind. It's zippy and bright in feel, with lively, briny acidity, and the finish shows fantastic evolution that ends on a earthy, forest-foliage note. Drink now2025."

"Plenty of attention seems to have been lavished on this wine produced from the best parcels on the estate.

The finish is moderately long, tinged by struck slate and smoke."
"Intensely chalky, smoky mineral tones penetrate through bracing white grapefruit and tangerine in this delicately sweet kabinett.

"Ripe, rich tangerine, apricot and peach pulsate through this light-bodied yet powerfully fruity sptlese. It's unctuously concentrated yet balanced by spine tingling acidity and a murmur of lime zest on the finish. Delightful already but likely to improve further through at least 2030."

Hailing from the Rocks District, it offers generous aromas of black olive, plum, wet gravel, crushed flower, green olive, smoked meat, parsley and dried herb. These lead to pure, ample fruit and savory flavors. A taste of smoked meat lingers on the finish."
"Aromas of baked plum, underbrush and balsamic notes lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, tobacco and licorice, with fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2025."
"This wine has a compelling, exuberant black-fruit character that makes it taste alive and buoyant despite a thick layer of fine-grained tannin and very full body. Blackberry jam, black cherry compote and dark chocolate power the flavors and linger on the finish."
"A firmly structured wine, this is powerful and dense. It comes from a 14-acre property dominated by Merlot that gives the wine weight, rich fruit and juicy acidity. The result is a wood-aged wine full of spice and with a dry core that is packed with fruit. Drink from 2025."
"Owned by the Rivire family, which also owns a Saint-milion-based negociant firm, this estate has produced a generous, ripe wine. The 85% Merlot in the blend gives a jammy, rich character that will soften and broaden as the wine matures. A firm structure within the rich fruitiness will allow the wine to develop. Drink from 2024."

Drink from 2024."
"The Chanfreau family continues its skilled course with this ripe, full and rich wine. Tannins from both the fruit and wood are prominent, giving a dry character to this youthful wine. However, the rich black-currant fruit is developing well. This wine has a long-term future. Drink from 2025."
"The luxury cuve from this estate, this blend includes 70% Merlot and 30% Malbec. It is still wood laden, with strongly toasty flavors that are balanced by opulent black fruits and firm tannins that promise a richly succulent wine. It will need plenty of time, so don't drink before 2022."
"A half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend, this wine is richly structured and packed with fruit. It has a perfumed character, juicy with blackberry flavors and acidity. Drink this opulent Patrick Meynard wine from 2024."
"This is the winery's first release off its Taylor Mag Vineyard. Aromas don't reveal their charms on first pour, with notes of caf au lait, cherry, raspberry, woodspice and herb. The palate brings firm, brawny tannins along with plentiful cherry flavors. Cocoa notes linger on the finish. It's everything you expect from a Cabernet, at a price below many wines from this appellation."
"This winery is under new ownership and off to a good start with this widely available, succulent and flat-out delicious Pinot. Spicy cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors fill out a big midpalate. It boasts tannins that are ripe, supple and proportionate. This lovely wine should be enjoyed over the next couple of years."
"Here's a vibrant sparkler with delicate but alluring scents of white stone fruit, citrus blossom, hay and bread dough. The elegantly sparkling palate presents golden apple, lemon zest, toasted almond and dried mountain herb set against bright acidity."
"The best of an outstanding white wine lineup, this enters the palate with the clarity of a mountain lake. The clean and crisp fruit flavors of melon and white peach gently pull in accents of butter and caramel, without any single component dominating. It's very fine winemaking."
"A fleshy hint of ripe cherry creates an inviting nose. The palate is similarly fruity but also firm with fine tannins. There is something rustic, rugged and earthy about this, but in a very engaging way. Slightly rustic but quite alluring. Drink 20182025."
"Camphor, sandalwood, new leather and a whiff of wild berry aromas lead the way. The bright palate mirrors the nose, offering red cherry, pomegranate and star anise framed in fresh acidity and taut polished tannins."
"Telltale cinnamon and vanilla headiness hints at new some oak on the nose. The palate offers red cherry flavors that are juicy enough to counterbalance the oak. For now, fine tannins coat the mouth but give structure for fruit and oak to express their well-matched tones. A modern take on Alsace Pinot but with ample freshness."
"The honeysuckle scent on the nose has an alluring edge of candied lemon peel. The palate, despite being slender and fresh, shows a similarly decadent streak. This lovely fruitiness is joined by more orange peel freshness and a concentrated texture. This is joyous and rich, with a dry, enduring finish."
"There's a telltale licorice-like spice that comes from many Temecula Valley wines, and this blend, which throws Syrah in with four Bordeaux varieties, offers a hint of that, but in a well-measured way. Add to that candied blueberry fruit and baking spice on the nose, and black currant, gingerbread and polished tannins on the palate, and this is a winning wine."
"This offers classic Sangiovese aromas of wild cherry, tilled soil, blue flower, pipe tobacco and a whiff of truffle. The aromas flow over seamlessly to the polished palate along with a hint of licorice. Reflecting the cool, wet vintage, it's more delicately structured than usual but is a fantastic effort. Drink through 2020."
"Almost overripe aromas of prune and raisin are at the fore on the nose. A full, chewy palate shows big tannins and roasted, earthy flavors of olive, spice cake and berry fruits. Assertive tannins linger through the finish, with flavors of licorice, herbs and chocolate. Drink through 2022."
"Classic is a pretty good description of this wine. It's meaty, firm, muscular and loaded with ripe blackberry and black-cherry fruit. The ripe ample tannins support that compact strength, and it has the balance and structure to cellar for the next decade. Drink 20202030."
This dense wine has great tannins as well as rich fruit. Juicy crispness gives the wine balance and aging potential. Wood aging for eight months has smoothed the wine and given it extra richness. Drink from 2019.
"Once again this cuve expresses exceptional elegance and finesse. There's a floral top note that leads into a quite pretty palate, with plum, cherry and a touch of cocoa. Drink now through the mid-2020s."
"Aromas of fig, chopped mint and tobacco follow over to the structured full-bodied palate along with steeped prune, cranberry and licorice. Tightly woven fine-grained tannins provide the framework while fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors. Drink 20232033."
"This very full-bodied wine is a great deal for $14. It tastes smoky and spicy, weaving herbaceous, savory nuances with meaty ones while a rich and relatively gentle texture coats the palate and holds onto the charred, beefy flavors on the finish."
"A smooth entry is focused on red and blue berries and plums, with a whiff of sweet tobacco and a vein of chocolate. There's a stiff edge to the tannins, and overall this seems a bit lighter, less concentrated, than in past vintages."
A distinctive blueberry aroma and flavor joins with spicy black pepper in this vivid and fascinating but not overly heavy wine made without added sulfites. It's about as elegant as Petite Sirah gets. An almost silky texture emerges despite firm tannins and there's a sense of focus from the first whiff through the lingering finish.
"This wine comes from the oldest vines in the estate. Richly fruity, it has dense blackberry flavors as well as layers of tannins. The dry core of the wine and its acidity promise aging. Solid and ripe, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"Lovely, bright notes of green citrus, pear, greengage and fig set the stage for this crisp, refreshing white, with secondary hints of fresh straw, lanolin and strawberry hull add additional layers of interest. The palate boasts a fresh, chalky mineral texture, with a final hint of just-toasted almond on the evolving close. Drink now2023."
"Earthy tones of fresh tilled soil, licorice root and sweet char lead the bouquet of this wine, grounded by the ripe black-fruit core. Velvety in texture, yet somewhat firm in structure, the palate boasts flavors of ripe black cherry and berry that carry through to the finish alongside hints of curing spice and hickory smoke. Drink now2021."
"This is made from two estate vineyards in partnership with a restaurant, Poggio, in Sausalito, where the winery owner lives. Combining 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec into its own unique cuve, and then aged in less oak than many of the winery's other wines to make it pairable with Poggio's cuisine, it offers mountain notes of sage, leather, cedar and graphite within a dense, structured frame of chocolate-covered blackberry."
"Quite light in the glass, this bottling from three famous vineyards in the appellation shows intriguing aromas of candied raspberry with hints of sage, thyme, star anise and pickled rose petals. It's light and easy on the palate, with flavors of hibiscus and cranberry. Goes down fast."
"There's a leathery, tobacco-like seam throughout this dark and masculine Cab, adding intrigue to the black plum and cassis core. Hints of char and roasted coffee give a rich impression to the palate, which feels plush and velvety in texture yet well-structured and defined. The finish is long and evolving, with an enduring grip and final notes of cigar box and black-fruit skin. Drink 20212025."
"Though disconcertingly packaged in a Burgundy bottle (hence the whimsy?) this is another delicious Riesling from Styring. Rolling fruit flavors of apple, pear, peach and tangerine support pink-grapefruit acids. It's tangy and tasty, not too tart, and persists through a clean, crisp finish."
"This blend of Zinfandel from Bailey Ranch, Will's Hills and Osgood Farms offers aromas of dark strawberry, black cherry and a dusty baked-earth minerality. The dark black fruit is prominent on the sip, where richness is central to the experience, with hints of dried marjoram giving depth and a rising acidity on the finish."
"Unusual and delicate aromas include dried herb, graphite and balsamic notes that carry over to the refined palate along with Golden Delicious, lemon zest and toasted bread crust. A walnut note closes the finish."
"A chocolaty, well-oaked nose with minerality and core cassis aromas is contradicted by a juicy palate with bright acidity and tension. Dry, salty flavors of berry and cassis are mildly toasted, while this wine is peppery and snappy on an acid-driven finish. The acid level on this wine suggests more aging; drink through 2032."
"Sun-kissed yellow cherry and mango notes are juxtaposed by struck flint, salt and slate in this spry yet powerfully fruity Riesling. The midpalate is sweet and spicy yet intensely mineral, reverberating through a long, stony finish. Drinks well already but likely to improve from 2021."
"Fleshy and fully tannic, this is a big bold 100% varietal red from one estate. Dried herb, cedar and black current give it a classic character of savory seasoning and appropriate herbaceousness."
"This is a 100% varietal wine, made in a dark concentrated style that's perfumed in cherry blossom. Taut sinewy layers of cassis and ever-present tannin combine effortlessly into a seamless whole, with accents of cedar and graphite."
"Quite young and powerful at the moment, this broody Margaret River Cabernet offers up ripe cherry, mocha, florals and dusty, herbal oak notes. The palate is rich and plush, with more oak driven herbacousness, chewy tannins and a savory finish. Set this in the cellar for a few years and try it again with some more age on it. Drink 20192032."
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this elegant sparkler offers aromas of yellow stone fruit and white spring flower. The creamy palate delivers ripe yellow apple, crushed herb and tangerine zest alongside a soft perlage."
"Notes of rosehip, clove, nutmeg, red currant, rhubarb and wild strawberry all abound on the nose and mouth in this fresh, vibrant wine. Fine tannins lend a soft structure to the medium-weight palate, with bright acidity providing freshness and levity. Hints of Dr. Pepper and tart red currant ride out the mouthwatering close. Drink now2021."
"Seven clones contribute to this blend, an aromatic and elegant wine with wild berries, a touch of rhubarb, and some peppery green highlights. It's light but not at all thin, nor does it short the finish. In fact, it's deceptively long, and that is its real strength."
"This is three-quarters Pommard, the rest a field blend from low-yielding reserve-quality vines, and treated to 50% new French oak. Lightly peppery and herbal, its berry fruit comes with suggestions of chicken stock and a dash of sea salt. Not quite as concentrated as previous vintages, but balanced and drinking nicely."
A reserved earthy nose smells a bit leafy and stalky. A wide palate with hard tannins delivers textbook Rioja flavors of dried cherry and spiced berry fruits. An earthy note alongside chocolate on the finish ensures that is very much in the vein of Rioja gran reserva. Drink through 2027.
"Aromas of underbrush, pipe tobacco, toasted oak and a whiff of baked plum appear in the forefront. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and grilled herb framed in austere close-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to relax then drink to catch the fruit richness."
"A ripe, balanced wine, this is full of generous fruit, rich tannins and blackberry flavors. Acidity comes through this concentrated wine to give a crisp edge. This wine, with a blend dominated by 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, will age well. Drink from 2024."
The old vines of the Laride estate go into this wine. Serious wood aging has given a dark-toast and bitter-chocolate character that currently masks the rich blackberry and black-plum fruits. The wine needs time. Drink from 2021.
"From a blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured wine. Its tannins and black-currant fruit are balancing well, giving both a dry side and a rich, juicy aftertaste. This wine has good potential, so drink from 2022."
"Pear, citrus zest, brioche and toast aromas flow over to the vibrant palate along with tangerine and yellow apple skin. Bright acidity and small continuous bubbles lend freshness and finesse. A bitter-almond note closes the finish."
"Delightful aromas of red plum and cherry tomato float above bread dough and basil on the nose. The juicy palate brings tart cherry and more plum into the mix, with white pepper and green herb accents. This offers a light and easy mouthfeel full of vibrant acidity and structured by velvety tannins. The juicy cherry finish is utterly charming."
"A blend of 35% Chenin Blanc, 23% Roussanne, 15% Clairette, 19% Viognier and 8% Smillon, this is dense and softly toasty upfront, with seductive notes of baked apple, pressed yellow flowers, dried orange peel, straw and lanolin. The palate is similarly lush and decadent, though with an ample seam of acidity to keep it all in check. Drink now2022."
"A touch of Mirabelle plum joins a fresh Conference pear note on the nose. The same fresh, clean flavors are abundant on the refreshing palate, which is toned, dry and has lovely concentration and poise."
"Juicy white grapefruit and lime notes are accented by hints of smoke, spice and crushed earth in this easy drinking yet exhilarating kabinett. It's light footed and approachably fruity yet lingers on a refreshing mineral finish."
"While initially closed and earthy, time and aeration coax prettier notes of blossom, melon and peach. It's still a deeply mineral sptlese, full of crushed stone and earth, but also a bounty of ripe stone fruit and tangerine. The finish is moderately long, ending on a slightly astringent crushed-vitamin note."
"Aromas of dried herb, dark cherry, black raspberry and barrel spice are at the fore on this 100% varietal wine. They lead to sleek cherry and cranberry flavors that provide intrigue."
"Somewhat shy and reserved at first, with time this comes around to reveal pleasantly nuanced notes of white peach, pear and pineapple core, as well as hints of white florals. There's a vibrant verve to the palate, with nervy notes of green plum and lime rind that carry through to the clean, mouthwatering finish. Drink now2020."
"This likable white is made in a light vibrant style, utilizing only neutral oak. Apricot fuzz and mellow toast ride along a thick acid-driven road of green apple skin, melon and fig."
"This is a 100% varietal wine from William Hill Estate grapes. It is a softly textured effort that offers the perfect amount of underlying tannic grip. Cinnamon, red currant and plum flavors complement cured meat, black olive, soy and black licorice."
"The winery's Dundee Hills bottling mixes fruit from three vineyards, two dating back to the 1970s. Black-cherry fruit fills out with nuances of black olive, black tea and roasted coffee. Everything is handled with balance and clarity, and the finishing tannins are light and supple."
"High-toned, vivid notes of red, tart cherry rise from the glass. The palate adds more dimension and richness to the fruit, but this remains slender and wonderfully tart throughout. The tannins are fine but could do with a little more focus. Nonetheless, a rustic charm plays about this."
"Forest floor, truffle, leather, spiced blueberry and scorched-earth aromas all take shape in the glass. Round and juicy, the chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, blackberry and licorice alongside polished, seasoned tannins. Drink through 2021."
"The Applegate Valley is looking more and more like the perfect spot for Syrah in southern Oregon. Here are pretty mulberry and blueberry fruit flavors, with medium concentration and snappy tangy acids. The flavors are persistent and balanced, and hints of bacon and cured meats put a varietal signature on the finish."
"The aim here, according to the winery, is to show both floral and earthy components. The floral, sweetly fruity aspect is front and center, and you can find lighter, more subtle suggestions of earth and dried leaves as well. It's a working blend, and a wine best consumed over the next five years."
"This wine offers a bouquet of cherry, raspberry and coffee bean. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry and coffee bean wrapped in subtle tannins are followed by a vein of eucalyptus that continues into the cool, minty finish."
"Plummy blueberry, black cherry and black currant wrap around a softly layered core of toasted oak in this light and delicate take on the oft-hearty variety. Smatterings of vanilla and dark chocolate tease on the finish."
"Forward and nicely structured, with lime, grapefruit and green-apple flavors, this strikes a perfect balance from start to finish. It's clean, true to variety and annotated with suggestions of wet stone. A great choice for your every-day Chardonnay."
The merest touch of honeysuckle plays on the fresh apple nose. The slender palate offers lemon freshness and a pithy texture. The finish is clean and combines ripe pear with vivid lemon.
"Aromas of waxy melon, orange rind, pear flesh and white flowers set the stage on the nose of this attractive white. The palate is full yet harmonious, the ripe fruit tones balanced by ample acidity and a lingering note of citrus pith on the close. Drink now2020."
"Aromas of baked plum, coconut and vanilla carry over to the medium-bodied palate along with dried black cherry, dark baking spice and star anise. Close-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Drink through 2023."
"This opens with aromas of raspberry, violet and baking spice that carry over to the bright easygoing palate along with a touch of white pepper. Fresh acidity and velvety tannins provide supple support."
"Made entirely with Syrah, this opens with aromas of cedar, black currant and a hint of thyme. The juicy palate delivers blackberry jam, tobacco and a touch of truffle alongside fine-grained tannins."
"Warm spices and rich fruits fill up this plush, flavorful and mouth-filling wine that is 90% Zinfandel. It smells like balsam and cedar and tastes like plums and cardamom while soft tannins make it cushy on the palate yet give just a little bite to keep it appetizing."
"The nose offers slight hints of lemon and yeast, with a herbal note reminiscent of fern. The slender palate fills out with a savory note and adds white pepper to accentuate a green tinge."
"An earthy hint plays on the nose before disappearing on the palate. The body is very slender, showing a high-toned freshness of lemon that pervades from start to finish. This ends wonderfully refreshing, dry and clean."
"The 2014 was designated as Nysa vineyard; this is simply labeled Dundee Hills. Very young, almost like a barrel sample, this offers raspberry and cherry fruit backed with ample acidity and showing a touch of heat. The finish turns tangy, with a hint of interesting funk."
"This blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Syrah and 10% Teroldego presents aromas of red-skinned berry, Mediterranean scrub and green peppercorn. The aromas follow through to the bright savory palate along with a hint of cinnamon while velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide support. Drink through 2019 to capture the fruit and freshness."
"Intense, ripe and textured, this wine is strongly mineral in character. It is balanced with vibrant apple fruitiness as well as concentration from the old vines in the blend. This wine could do with another few months aging, so drink from 2019."
"Delicate scents suggesting dried aromatic herb, wild berry, purple flower, leather and underbrush slowly emerge. Mirroring the nose, the firm, structured palate offers Marasca cherry, pomegranate, star anise and an earthy hint of game alongside vibrant acidity and rather grainy tannins. It has a rustic charm but it's also savory and full of personality."
"The forward and fruity Pommard clone shines brightly here, cloaked in flavors of ginger cookies and plum cake. It's spicy and front loaded, and it seems to be peaking about now. Hints of stem and astringency come up in the aftertaste. The advice from here is drink it now through 2019."
"This was barrel fermented in French oak, presumably some of it new or once-used, as there is a light and pleasingly toasty frame around baked-apple flavors. It drinks like an apple pastry, with enough acid to prop it up and keep flavors lively."
"A lovely coppery hue, this is a full-bodied wine with plentiful flavors of citrus, strawberries and cherries. It broadens out in the mouth, without losing focus, and brings in a streak of sassafras. As with most ross, it should be consumed with two years of the vintage."
"From one of the premium vineyards in the Lisboa region, this wine is made from some of the oldest vines in the estate. Its rich character and spice from wood aging are still young although they show ripe promise. Textured and mineral, it will be ready to drink from 2019."
"From a blend that includes several local white grape varieties, this wood-aged wine has attractive soft fruit and a smooth texture. Touches of spice from the wood aging are well integrated with the orange and lemon-zest flavors and crisp apples. Drink this wine from late 2018."
"Pretty and fruit-forward, this leads with attractive aromas of ripe dark berries and bramble that are hit by a good dose of tobacco leaf and purple flowers. The palate is juicy and lush, but not overdone, with tasty plum and berry flavors that are supported by fine tannins and a spicy, oaky overlay. Drink now2020."
"White stone fruit, toast and bread crust aromas follow over to the vibrant palate along with yellow apple, fennel and bitter walnut. Bright acidity and a lively perlage provide the backdrop."
"White wild flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of nut lead the nose. Reflecting the aromas, the bright palate offers yellow apple, lemon zest, graphite and toasted nut alongside vibrant acidity and a lively refined mousse."
"This Pinot is forward and fruity, bursting with lush flavors of ripe plum and maraschino cherry. A thin vein of dark chocolate threads through the tannins. The length and structure suggest that this can be aged another half decade or longer."
"Pipe tobacco, wild berry and star anise aromas set the tone on this light-bodied but savory red. The bright, almost ethereal palate reflects the nose, offering Marasca cherry, licorice and a hint of graphite framed in polished tannins."
"Also known as Mencia in Spain, this grape has established itself in the Do region in Portugal. It makes a soft wine, low in acidity while rich in black fruits. It has plenty of almost-sweet fruit, ripe tannins and a rounded, smooth aftertaste. Drink now."
"Deliciously dry and mouthfilling, this full-bodied red packs in black cherry, boysenberry and mint flavors and wraps them in a velvety, softly tannic texture. Made from Merlot, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot, it has wonderful ripeness and richness."
"This is a pretty, even sexy style, that matches its crisp green apple core to lightly buttery barrel toast. It's a classic combination, well executed, not too ripe, but fresh, clean and quite tasty."
"This wine is thick in youthful tannin and earthy intriguean explosive, spicy and exotic expression of the variety that's all in. Wild strawberry, pine, clove and black tea intermingle with purpose and distinct power."
"Underbrush, chopped herb, baked plum and a whiff of new leather aromas take shape in the glass. The taut dense palate offers prune, blackberry extract and licorice framed in tightly knit close-grained tannins that give the finish a grip."
"Aromas of ripe plum, cake spice and menthol make their way to the forefront. On the full-bodied palate, taut fine-grained tannins support dried black cherry, prune and mocha. Fresh acidity lifts the brooding flavors."
"A nicely oaked bouquet includes aromas of tropical fruits, melon and green banana. This has a full, creamy palate, with oak resin and acidity balancing each other out. Salty melon and banana flavors are oaky, while this is texturally pleasing on the finish."
"Aromas of white stone fruit, bread crust and a whiff of aromatic herb float from the glass in this soft sparkler. The creamy palate doles out ripe yellow apple, white peach, toatsted hazelnut and a hint of ginger alongside a silky mousse."
"Spicy berry aromas come with a bell-pepper note. In the mouth, this wine is raw and somewhat abrasive. Plum and raspberry flavors are lightly herbal, while this is distinctly tannic, raw and tough on the finish. This quality wine begs for food."
"This is a block selection and the highest level effort of the winery's three Pinot Gris. Fermentation was carried out in both barrels and tanks, and that adds some welcome roundness and flesh to the midpalate. Citrus, cucumber and apple flavors come lightly touched with barrel toast. Drink now through 2021."
"This Shiraz-based blend, with 21% Cinsault and 8% Grenache, offers earthy notes of fresh mint, white pepper and herbal fynbos, all spicing up the red cherry and raspberry fruit core. A delicate whiff of sweet smoke is seductive, while the palate offers more earthy notes of tilled earth and currant leaf that carry through to the finish. Fine but structured tannins lend a velvety texture. Drink now2020."
"This bursts forth with spicy cranberry and cherry fruit. It's a bright vivacious wine, fruit-driven and lightly peppery. Thoughts of roast turkey inevitably come to mindsave a bottle for next Thanksgiving."
"Very light in the glass, this blend of 43% Grenache, 36% Syrah and 21% Mourvdre offers fairly simple yet likable berry aromas. There's a surprising amount of textural grip to the palate and loads of earthy minerality, with hibiscus, red plum and gravel flavors proving more complex than the nose implied."
"Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, new oak and exotic spice aromas are front and center. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, cranberry, oak, vanilla and coconut framed in tightly knit, fine-grained tannins. Drink 20192028."
"Fruit for this wine comes from Block Two of Gamache Vineyard. Aged in a mixture of stainless steel and French oak (30% new), the aromas offer notes of hay, corn silk, lees and cut yellow apple along with peach. Flavors are broad and leesy, gliding on the finish."
"Reduced, with a spritzy underbelly of acidity, this wine lands fresh and vibrant in dried herb and green apple, with a medium-bodied ripeness and use of oak."
"This is not your average red blend, because it has outstanding concentration, multiple layers of dark-fruit flavors and cedary, spicy nuances as well as a richly tannic texture. It will pair well with a grilled lamb chop, and should improve with a little age. Best after 2020."
"There's a growing trend of making red wines fresh, fun and ready to glug, and this bottling, which spent just six months in French oak, fits the movement perfectly. Bright aromas of rose, lilac, smashed black raspberry, candied plum skin and pepper dust dive into a zippy palate of cherry fruit, baking spice and dried ginger. Chill and drink on a hot day."
"From vines planted in 1983, this delivers old-vine complexity at a budget price. It's big, broad and fruity, with a range of candied strawberry, raspberry, cherry flavors. Those old vines ramp up the texture and add length as well."
"Fruity, herbal and with crisp acidity, this bright wine is full of grapefruit, apples and green plums. The mineral tang will give this wine shape as it matures. Drink from 2019."
"This oak-aged wine is the top cuve from this estate. The wood is prominent at this young stage, although there is also plenty of black fruit. The wood, as it integrates, will enrich this ripe wine, bringing out the firm structure. The wine needs to age. Drink from 2020."
"Set in the heart of Haut-Mdoc and close to the 18th-century fortress designed to stop the British attacking through the Gironde estuary (they never tried), this estate has made a firm, tannic wine that has great black fruits and a rich potential. Drink from 2022."
"Coming from up to 60 different parcels spread across 100 acres, this wine is impressive in its richness and fine, dusty tannins. It is dense, concentrated and sure to age well. Drink from 2023."
"As befits a wine that is part of this Pomerol satellite appellation, this is almost entirely Merlot. New-wood aging adds a minty character and dark-coffee flavor. Firm tannins, bold black fruits and balanced acidity all make their mark in this potentially opulent wine. Drink from 2021."

"This wine comes from a seven-acre property in the south of the Haut-Mdoc. Well textured, ripe with black fruits and firm with tannins, this is quite an enjoyable wine. It will develop into a beautiful, rich wine. Drink from 2024."
"The winery has re-released this wine, providing a close look at how a properly-stored Pinot can age. In this instance, quite gracefully, and now drinking at a pleasing balance between youthful fruit and the autumnal flavors of older wines. Spicy cranberries and flavors of mellow baked berries and cherries come along with a streak of cola. It should drink well for another four or five years."
"An extremely pale, orange-tinged color belies an aromatically expressive wine, with appealing notes of white pepper, wild raspberry and herb. The palate is sumptuous yet light in feel, with achingly pure fruit flavors. This wine is all about eleganceperhaps too much for some tastes. But for those seeking the variety's delicate side, look no further. Drink now."
"The nose is a subtle combination of the merest touch of cinnamon and red cherry. The palate is light and firm, with ample freshness and a lovely impression of tart fruit. This is understated and fresh in a savory style."
"Plumes of saffron, spice and crushed earth accent ripe yellow-cherry and honeysuckle notes in this deeply honeyed sptlese. Equal parts sun-kissed fruit and earth offset by dazzling lemon-lime acidity, it's a deftly balanced wine that offers a pleasantly astringent finish."
"Forward, fruity tones of peach candy and tangerine stand in contrast to this producer's leaner, earthier Abtsfronhof bottling. They share the same deeply embedded minerality that lends elegance and structure to this dry but approachable wine. While frisky and spry on the midpalate, the finish is long and lean."
"This is a well-made vineyard-designate, showing a full embrace of integrated oak and full-bodied richness. Red fruit, leather, meat and black licorice all figure into the mix, as the thickness in the glass suggests decanting or time to air."
"This crisp lively sparkler delivers aromas and flavors of yellow apple, juicy citrus zest, bread crust and savory mineral. It's balanced, with bright acidity while a refined continuous perlage lends finesse."
"There are inviting aromas of dark-skinned berry, bay leaf and a hint of ginger in this 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot blend. The savory, balanced palate delivers ripe blackberry, star anise and a touch of espresso alongside fine-grained tannins."
"Rich and fruity, this is a lovely, satisfying wine that's medium bodied and salty in oak. Asian five spice and cola dominate alongside black pepper and cinnamon, the dark cherry and strawberry dense and balanced."
"Thick and dusty in leathery tannins, this is a robust, well-built wine, exhibiting a wealth of varietal character, from cedar and pencil to black currant and cranberry. It finishes on lingering impressions of bright acidity and spice."
"A limited (two barrel) vineyard selection, this offers mixed citrus and berry fruit, principally oranges and raspberries. It's set up by refreshing natural acidity, and finished with a broad streak of milk chocolate. All in all it's ready for near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging."
"Not to be confused with the winery's Aret reserve version of this same wine, this offers considerable pleasure at a lower cost. The steely core of ripe tree fruits is cloaked in pretty toast. A classic combination for many domestic Chardonnays, here supported with Oregon's exceptional natural acidity. In the resonant finish you'll note a hint of honeycomb."
"Ripe, soft and fruity, this is a delicious, accessible wine. It has red-berry fruits, soft integrated tannins and ripe fruitiness. This wine will develop quickly and easily. Drink from 2019."
"Only the slightest hints of lemon and bruised apple reach the nose. The palate has the same combination of very lithe lemon overtones on an earthy, light palate with notes of bruised apple flesh. This is dry, fresh and light and very moreish in an unusual, earthy but authentic way."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Ciliegiolo opens with aromas of ripe raspberry, baking spice and a hint of violet. The juicy balanced palate doles out red currant, dried black cherry and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Rather ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum join lemon and green pear notes on the nose. On the palate, a lemon note cuts through the slender, lithe but expressive body. The finish is whistle-clean, dry and very refreshing."
"Dark colored and rich, this smooth wine is poised between sweet and dry. It offers good acidity at the same time as really ripe fruit and a generous texture. This wine, although it is ready to drink, could well age. Drink now or keep until 2020."
"This is an attractive, easy-going Pinot at an affordable price from winemaker Tim Knappstein. Ripevery nearly confectedred cherry and strawberry aromas are made more appealing by whispers of tree bark, dried herbs and savory, meaty and smoky components. The medium-bodied palate offers even more bark and medicinal herb characters, finishing on a sappy, black-fruited note."
"Vibrant in aromas of spicy cherry, blackberry and wild mint, this Primitivo sees no time in oak, opting for aging in cement tanks. This translates to pure fruit expression on the palate, showing juicy red cherry and strawberry, with flecks of spice, earth and crushed stone adding nuance to the medium-length finish. Lithe in feel, but with proper tannic grip, this is a savory and enticing expression of the variety."
"Hints of crunchy apricot, apple and pear are juxtaposed by racy streaks of lemon-lime acidity. The palate is more mineral and earth than fruit but elegant and composed, finishing with reverberating lime-zest astringency."
"Aromas of toast and yellow apple lead the nose on this lively sparkler while the vibrant palate doles out ripe tangerine zest, mature yellow pear and a hint of bitter almond. Fresh acidity and a vivacious perlage buoy up the rich flavors."
"Brioche, bread crust and white stone-fruit aromas follow through to the bright palate along with yellow apple and citrus. Fresh acidity and a creamy perlage provide the backdrop while a white almond note signals the close."
"Subdued aromas of stewed prune, sunbaked earth and a whiff of dark baking spice follow over to the dense fleshy palate, together with hints of licorice and nutmeg. Velvety tannins give it a smooth mouthfeel. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the brooding fruit."
This 100% varietal wine is juicy and dusty in concentrated flavors of cinnamon stick and baked plum. Firm tannins support without distraction and give way to a soft lengthy texture of fruit-forward approachability.
"Quite impressive for the entry level Zin, this bottling by brewer-turned-winemaker Sherman Thacher shows black currant, loamy soil, vanilla and licorice on the nose. The palate is rounded with black-cherry flavors and minty herbs, proving a cohesive experience."
"Softly textured tannins surround a hefty full-bodied plushness of plummy cobbler, blueberry and dark chocolate in this well-made, robust and rich wine. Caramel and mocha appear on the lengthy finish."
"Tomato leaf, dried herb and cedar are offered on the nose and palate of this wine, which is well-integrated in oak. Full-bodied and grippy, it's youthful in structure, with final notes of pencil shavings and focused acidity."
"A dark potent wine, this blends smoky black-cherry fruit with a streak of cola and a generous helping of brown spices. The chewy finish has a nice lick of minerality which keeps it aloft."
"Pommard clone wines are generally fruit-forward, as shown here, with a pleasing array of red and blue berries and fruit. Tangy acids prop up the focused core and lead into a tight finish dotted with baking spices."
"The ripest of the winery's 2013 Pinots, this rounds out the fruit with pretty raspberry and cherry flavors. Light touches of oranges and chocolate are also evident, and the overall balance, length and elegance are fine. Just two barrels were produced, one new and one neutral."
"This cuve aims, the winery explains, for the most elegant expression of the estate vineyard. It succeeds, with minimal barrel influence (50% once-filled) around pretty flavors of raspberries and citrus. Finishing details bring up lemon rind, pineapple and a touch of cola."
"High acid yet tilting toward off dry with 13 g/l residual sugar, this shows the spicy side of the grape, rather than dousing the drinker in perfume. It plays out broadly peachy across the palate, dotted with hints of powdered sugar, ginger and melon."
"Production continues to climb on this widely available well-priced Oregon sparkling wine. A tawny straw color, it's vibrant and fresh, with yeasty dough accents around pear fruit. The balance and concentration suggest it may be cellared for up to a decade, but it's drinking quite well right now."
"Not one of the biggest or boldest versions, this earthy wine is medium to full bodied and firmly tannic, offering untamed aromas and flavors of earth, barnyard, beef and wild blackberry. It's funky in a good way, very interesting to taste and has good balance, too."
"Pressed wild flower, ripe yellow stone fruit and brioche aromas abound on this lively sparkler. The vibrant palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, tangerine zest and bitter almond alongside tangy acidity. A vivacious perlage provides the backdrop."
"Bracing lemon zest and orange blossom perfume brightens this robustly concentrated sptlese. Fresh tangerine and apricot flavors are bright and sweet, accented by spine tingling acidity and a reverberating orange-pith finish."
"This is a stunning concoction, a mix of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Syrah, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Together they combine to offer a classically structured elegance of dried herb and juicy red currant that finds companionship in gamy meat and white pepper."
"Notions of ripe cherry fruit are evident from the start. This is fruity and fresh, full of tart cherry tones and a refreshing conifer edge. The body is slender and the light tannins offer a little crunch. A lovely, easy, authentic and fruit-driven wine."
"Bramble, licorice root and fresh fynbos lead the nose of this attractive wine, grounded by bold black-cherry and boysenberry fruit at its core. Firmly structured tannins lend serious grip and texture, while fruity flavors transition into waves of olive tapenade, cured meat and peppery spice on the enduring finish. It's drinkable now, but should be best with a bit more time; drink 20202025."
"This blend of 60% Aglianico and 40% Montepulciano boasts tobacco, methol and crushed herbs over a core of spicy bramble berries on the palate. There's solid structure, weight and intensity which echos the tones of the nose and carries those flavors on a tight mineral vein."
"This wine leans into the savory, with aromas of sliced green pepper along with assorted fresh herbs, flowers and macerated cherry. The palate is soft in style, filled with sleek, minerally cherry flavors. It brings a sense of freshness, purity and elegance."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Petit Verdot, this has aromas that recall black-skinned berry, violet, leather and tilled soil. The concentrated, balanced palate doles out black currant, tobacco, licorice and a touch of tar framed in polished tannins. Enjoy through 2022."
Hints of mint and cedar in the aroma lead to full ripe fruit flavors like black cherry and blueberry in this Merlot-based Bordeaux-style blend. It has full body and moderate tannins that give just enough heft and grip on the palate.
"A traditional Bordeaux-style blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Franc, this is jammy and spicy upfront, boasting assertive fruit notes of boysenberry, mulberry and black plum that are hit by spicy tones of cigar box, leather and allspice. Medium in weight, it offers firm tannins that are partnered with ample acidity, lending lift to the close. Drink now2021."
"A perfumed nose of honeysuckle and lemon has just a touch of earthiness about it. The palate is translucent, rounded but light, carrying intense notes of lemon edged by floral perfume. The finish is wonderfully dry."
"Lemon, honeysuckle, lime and rose petal aromas unite into a perfumed, appealing nose. The light palate adds a fruity dollop of ripe, yellow plum to these flavors and boosts them with creamy richness. This is a rounded but still dry and fresh Muscat with a wonderfully lasting echo."
"A touch of earthiness and lemon pith play on the quiet nose. The palate is fresh in feel, with an intriguing touch of herbal bitterness. Concentrated and intense, this remains taut nonetheless."
"Lemon and earth aromas on the nose lead onto a dry and gently pear-fruited palate. There is an element of softness, a creamy touch radiating from a ripe, concentrated core of subdued Mirabelle and pear fruit. The finish is rich, resonant and dry."
"Coming mostly from esteemed Riverbend Vineyard, this wine saw just 10% new French oak, putting the focus on the fruit. High-toned aromas of dried flower, herb, cherry, vanilla and dried cranberry lead to a full, flavorful palate packed to the brim with dark fruit. Cranberry flavors linger on the finish."
"With a backbone of well-defined acidity, this coastal white is creamy in texture, with highlights of fig, pear and toasted oak. Juicy and likable, it lingers in a vanilla wafer tone."

"This is a well-blended red, combining 73% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Pungent earth and tobacco highlight a soft round palate of dried herb, clove and red and black currant, finishing in cherry-vanilla."
"Delicate tangerine and yellow peach flavors are layered in smoke and dusty slate in this sprightly off-dry Riesling. It's a light-footed, piercing wine anchored by nervous lemon-lime acidity. The finish is long and lean, accented by a touch of dried herb."
"This is a friendly, attractive and easy to like bottling. It boasts solid fruit concentration, expressed in waves of raspberry sauce, brambly boysenberry and just a touch of dark chocolate. The medium-weight palate shows a bit more restraint, with herbal tones of raspberry leaf and cherry stem. Drink now2020."

"Classic Rioja aromas of vanilla, tobacco and dried red fruits are on display. In the mouth, this wine has bracing natural acidity that supports ripe flavors of baked berry fruits and brown sugar. Raisiny hints on the finish suggest drinking this sooner rather than later."

"Sourced from the clay soils of the Montevella Vineyard, this Primitivo sees no time in oak, yet brims with complexities. Bergamot, cedar oil and moist earth aromas ride over a core of dense blackberry. These notes echo on the full-bodied palate, balanced by vibrant acidity and an energizing mineral vein that lingers on and on."
"This ripe, lightly wood-aged wine is made from a blend of Chardonnay and Arinto. Rich while also crisp, the wine is warm, generous and packed with both fruit and minerality. It is still developing, so drink this wine from 2019."
"With its eight months in wood, this wine is opulent, spicy and ripe. It has great fruit as well as plenty of judicious wood-aging flavors. The yellow fruits such as pear are cut with citrus to give a rounded, rich wine that will age further. Drink from late 2018."
"A dark, gritty, spicy nose with aromas of black peppercorn, coffee and black fruits sets up a high-acid palate with lemony oak. Flavors of vanilla and creamy oak dominate, while the finish echoes what came before: oak, creamy notes and lemony acid. Drink now through 2027."
"Meaty, sanguine flavors greet the straightforward entry to this appellation wine, a showcase of the area's warm climate. Substantial concentration builds along the midpalate, dusted in clove, black cherry and berry."

"This bottling was first produced in 1985 and was the first commercial Chardonnay made in Puglia. Over 30 years later, this is a solid representation of the variety, grown on the limestone hills of the Castel del Monte DOC.

"Sourced from clay-rich vineyards outside the coastal town of Trani, this blend of 50% Uva di Troia, 35% Merlot and 15% Syrah is slightly jammy on the nose in aromas of stewed red and black berries, with a dusting of coffee and crushed herbs.

"This unusual blend mixes Riesling with rarely-seen Huxelrebe, a high-yielding early-ripening grape with scents similar to Muscat.

"Peach blossom, orchard fruit and bread crust aromas waft out of the glass. On the lively palate, fresh acidity provides the backdrop for yellow apple, fennel and lemon zest while a refined perlage lends finesse."
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this lively sparkler opens with aromas of brioche, wild red berry and crisp red apple. The aromas segue over to the vibrant palate along with a tangerine note. Tangy acidity lifts the finish while a hint of hazelnut signals the close."
"Charred beef, pepper dust, oregano, thyme and sage make for a savory entry to the nose of this bottling from the Malibu area, but there is aromatic lift from dried lilac aromas as well.

"Heavily roasted aromas of gamy berry fruits, herbs and coconutty oak settle on charred. This wine is bulky and a touch stewed and soupy in feel. Oaky flavors of chocolate, baked berry and cassis end with chocolaty oak on a finish that's heavy and lacking in verve. Drink through 2024."
"Set on the plateau above the northern bank of the Douro, this quinta's elevation makes it ideal for white wines. This wine is a field blend of old vines, with creamy rich fruit, baked-apple flavors as well as touches of vanilla and spice. The wine is ripe, full bodied and ready to drink."

"Aromas of the wood and anise lead to flavors of raspberry, strawberry, cured meat, smoke and eucalyptus. The tart cherry finish has notes of flint and smoke. Slightly grippy tannins and smoky flavors may be a little strong on their own, but this wine will work well alongside fatty cuts of meat."

"An appealing aroma of ripe pear fills the nose. The palate is similarly abundant in fruit yet ultimately feels clean, dry and slender."
"This reserve Chardonnay is slightly buttery and yeasty on the fore, brightened by aromas of green apple, fresh melon and a hint of tropical fruit. The palate is tightly structured, with crunchy fruit, a chalky textural weight and a long, green-apple finish."
"This is a barrel selection, seemingly chosen for its muscular aspect. The estate's characteristic sweet baking spices are amply in evidence, with ginger-cookie highlights. Fermented with native yeast and aged for 18 months in one-quarter new French oak, it should continue to drink well into the mid-2020s."

"This block is singled out in order to present a wine that has received full western exposure throughout the growing season. Using a basket press and native yeast fermentation, it's a well-defined effort with ripe cherry fruit and a streak of cola running down the spine. Medium bodied and full in the midpalate, it fades gently, though just a bit sooner than you'd like."
"Black cherry, tarragon, toasted coconut and anise show on the nose of this blend of 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 24% Merlot, 16% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec. The dark palate offers black currant, black plum, cocoa, light mint and crushed gravel on the finish. It's well structured."

"As ode to his family's butchering past, this red blend would go very well with one of the fatty steaks that winemaker Adam Comartin's relatives once cut. Aromas of licorice, sandalwood, lilac and jammy fruits lead into a palate loaded with clove, nutmeg, thyme and pepper spice, all set against a backdrop of boysenberry fruit."
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Syrah, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, leather and tobacco. The smooth, savory palate offers Morello cherry, star anise and licorice alongside polished tannins."

"Pretty fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry come together, balanced against juicy acids. It was 30% whole cluster fermented and aged in 15% new oak, which remains well in the background. Another year or two of bottle age might well improve this wine a point or two."
"This 100% Sangiovese has aromas of red-skinned berry, Mediterranean scrub and white pepper. It's bright and fresh, with crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry and clove. Polished tannins provide lithe support."
"This light and elegant wine displays inviting scents of bread, strawberry, raspberry and wet stone, with flavors to match. It's immaculately clean, well-defined and persistent. Drink over the next five years."
"After barrel fermentation (40% new) and extended barrique aging, this wine is bottled with some of the lees left, extending autolysis and intentionally diminishing fruit. It's oaky and textural, with a creamy, yeasty flavor more than any particular fruit. It's unusual and compelling, though not made in any conventional style."
"A hint of bruised apple plays on the nose but the palate shows ample freshness in flavors of ripe pear and apple, with a tart lemon balance. This is fruity and easy but also rather refreshing. Drink soon."
"A lieu-dit in French is a place historically recognized for what was there, a hazelnut (coudrat) tree. This wine comes from a single vineyard named after the trees grew there. It is a rich wine, packed with the bright fruit of the vintage as well as some firm tannins. Aged in wood, it has spice and toast as well as the black-currant fruits. Drink this wine from 2021."
"Made from 100% of the variety, this is expectedly dark in color and big and weighty in tannin and oak. Inviting aromas of cinnamon, mushroom, graphite and cedar give it more of a savory profile, searching for fruit, which appears in the form of black currant. The finish is bitter in leather and black pepper."

"The style of this LBV changes little. It is always a fruity, ready-to-drink Port, rich in black fruits and juicy acidity. It is perfumed, ripe, warming and lightly structured. It is ready to drink."

"Spicy, dense aromas of tobacco leaf, briar berries and tilled earth make for an engaging nose. The palate is a bit more primary in ripe dark fruit flavors, yet solidly balanced by fresh acidity and savory, medium-grained tannins."
"This remains stiffly compact, showing blue and purple fruits with a seam of chocolate mint. It was barrel aged entirely in neutral oak, and the tannins are smooth and polished. A bit of aeration would help to open it up."
"This wine is surprisingly dense and dark in aromatic character, with brooding notes of black cherry, cassis and blackberry that set the stage for an equally concentrated palate. The astringent tannins lend good grip, framing the plush, ripe fruit. Final hints of tree bark, chicory and char spice up the close."
"Syrah makes up half of this wine, with the rest equal parts Grenache and Mourvdre. Aromas of marionberry, herb, smoked meat and spice lead to a well-balanced palate that glides on the baking-spice-filled finish. The oak plays a bit prominently at times but overall it works."
"This is an unctuous tale on Chardonnay, very much in line with the classic Californian style. Aromas of baked Asian pear, oak, butterscotch and caramel show on the nose, leading into a broad, buttery and viscous palate of lemon balm and coconut cream."
"Inviting aromas of cherry cordial, dried herb and chalk lead to generous, well-fashioned fruit flavors. Light tannins provide support."
"The barrel influence is primarily aromatical with notes of nougat, vanilla and sweet spices out in front of cherry and red apple. The fruit vies with the oak for attention on the palate as well, although the latter shows a pleasing supple feel as well as excellent concentration. There's impressive fruit here, but the oak unfortunately gets in the way of it."
"There's a strong flavor of grilled fruits, especially peaches, and the red fruits are tangy and concentrated, like raspberry compote. A charred smoky streak runs through the tannins. All in all, though a bit heavy handed, this brings lots of potent flavors. Drink now through 2020."
"Principally Riesling, with 8% Muscat blended in, this touches the borders of off dry, but has enough acid to keep it food-friendly. Ripe lemon and pink grapefruit, peaches and apples come through most pleasantly. It's well made and well balanced."
"Toast, underbrush, licorice and charred-earth aromas carry over to the palate along with prune, blackberry extract, coconut and a confectionary note. Dusty tannins give it a rather grainy finish."
"A mix of 60% Chardonnay, 15% Moscatello Selvatico, 15% Minutolo and 10% Passulara, this unusual white blend is perfumed in grapefruit, tangerine zest, papaya and lemon balm aromas. Medium in weight, with a pleasing roundness, rich melon and exuberant floral flavors are lifted by clementine acidity and a light mineral dusting."
"The 1,500-foot elevation of the vineyards close to mountains gives this wine its crisp, bright character, allowing the acidity, the citrus and the zingy texture to shine. The wine is all tight fruit balanced by a creamy texture. Drink now."
"Notes of wet stone, Pilsner and yeast meet with fresher elements of lemon, white pepper and honeydew in this Chardonnay. Sprightly acidity lends itself well to the long, energetic finish."
"Though well made and easy drinking, this has an overall lightness that seems almost too thin. Flavors conjure up snippets of lemon rind, pineapple and honeydew melonfruity but lacking concentration. It's balanced with mineral acidity, and should be enjoyed while at its most fresh."
"Vibrant aromas of blue fruit, dried herb and potpourri lead to light, soft, tart fruit and barrel flavors. Blue-fruit flavors linger on the finish. It seems compact right now but good things are going on."
"This Chardonnay opens with alluring aromas of vanilla, lemon curd, dried apricot and pie crust. Lemon-lime acidity pulls together flavors of ripe peach and vanilla, with a hint of wood spice. Lime peel and spice linger on the fruity finish."
"Confident saline and citrus aromas are a good entry to this clean, fairly lean brut. Lime and tangerine flavors are racy and not too sweet, while this is fresh and well made on the finish."
"There's a surprising intensity to the aromas of fresh blackberries, turned earth and violets. The palate mirrors the nose in a package of grippy tannins and crisp acidity. While enjoyably straightforward in nature, the concentration is rather light, so enjoy for its immediate appeal."
"The best of Airlie's current white wine releases, this is bright and fruity, with cucumber and green apple in the mix. The mouthfeel is lively, and the flavors show a bit of residual sugar, resulting in an impression not entirely unlike vinous Gatorade."
"As the low alcohol suggests, this is a light and just barely ripe ros, a salmon shade with a blush of cherry red. Tart flavors of strawberry and rhubarb are dusted with a dash of Thai spices."
"A gold color and resiny aromas of nutty oak and oxidized white fruits capture the essence of aged white Rioja. A round, oily palate is dominated by oak, tasting of spiced apple, almond skins and woodspice. Flavors of peanut, dried apricot and stone-fruit pits provide for a good finish."
"Intense aromas of smoke, crushed earth and pollen permeate through sweet-tart lemon and lime flavors. It's savory yet invigorating, offering penetrating streaks of acidity that linger through a long finish."
"This blend of three vineyards, including one in Santa Barbara County, offers intriguing sweet-and-sour aromas of dried sage, bay leaf, forest floor and olive tapenade. Dried berry fruit shows on the sip alongside chaparral, and it tastes much older than its young age."
"Produced by Niepoort for the importer, this dense wine is rich in prunes and ripe black plums. Poised between sweet and dry, it has tannins as well as generous fruitiness and a liquorous, smooth aftertaste."
"This is a solid-quality wine that tastes good and fruity, has a nice blend of acidity and richness and a rather full body that coats the palate. It's enjoyable to drink and seems to have everything in good proportions."
"Aromas of cedar, dark-skinned fruit and baking spice lead the nose on this 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot blend. The firm palate offers black plum, clove and toast with tight assertive tannins. Drink 20192023."
"Earthy, buttery aromas join good fruity ones in this medium-bodied and mineral-tinged wine. It has firm acidity and a slightly astringent texture that give it a lean, bracing quality."
"This is the first vintage of this estate under the ownership of the Bouey family, which has a Bordeaux negociant business. The wine is dry, anchored in tannins at this stage although the juicy black fruits will come through over time. Wait for this wine until 2022."
"This is one of the most northerly of the Mdoc estates, only six miles from the ocean. That gives a cool feel to the wine, emphasizing fruit rather than structure. Plenty of juicy acidity gives the wine a lift. Drink from 2022."
"This northern Mdoc estate has produced a wine that has both structure and fruit. The tannins are certainly present, giving a burnt character from the wood aging. However, black currant flavors are there as well. Put the two together as they integrate, and the wine will be juicy and attractive. Drink from 2020."
"Pure, rich ripe Touriga Nacional gives a perfumed wine, rich in tannins and with a stylish character from the bright red fruits. The wine is juicy, balanced, and certain to age well. Drink from 2019."
"Dense soil aromas, leather, olive, charred beef, roasted wood and crushed asphalt make for a very dry and savory nose on this bottling. There's a tarry character to the palate that shadows the black fruit, allowing the black olive and black pepper to take the lead."
"Aromas seem unsettled, with notes of dust, herb and cherry. The flavors are plush and ripe, delivering plenty of enjoyment."
"This full, fleshy and affordable wine gets treated to small-lot ferments in neutral oak barrels. The fruit seems young and freshGamay-like, with bright and spicy berry flavors. Drink this over the next couple of years while that freshness remains in full force."

"Though it's a bit astringent, the medium-bodied fruit is clean and juicy, with raspberry and cherry flavors. It seems to spread out across the palate, then winds down gracefully as it flattens into a drying astringent finish."
"This tasty little Pinot introduces a well-made lineup from this producer. The pretty cherry fruit might seem delicate, but it's nonetheless persuasive. There's no thinness here; it's spot-on varietal and balanced throughout."
"This wine exhibits hearty oak and ripe black cherry, cranberry and plum. Blended with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, its grapes from Coombsville primarily, it's high-strung in supportive acidity and dried herb and tobacco."
"This three-acre site, planted to Dijon 114 Pinot, comes up with strong aromatics loaded with baking spices. Those sweet flavors continue around standard medium-ripe berry fruit. The acids finish a bit chalky, and the effect is to dry out the flavors a bit too quickly."
"This Cabernet Sauvignon expresses classic aromas and flavors of blackberry leaf, cassis, bramble, black pepper and eucalyptus. There is lovely oak integration that adds notes of clove and cedar. The tannic structure soft which make the finish feel shorter and more fruit forward."
"This wine carries pronounced tones of black currant, cassis, bramble, juniper and oak spice. The tannins are full but well integrated and hold up to the weight of this wine. The finish is long and woody."
"Notes of very ripe pear dominate the nose. The palate shows more freshness to aid the spicy pear fruit on the midpalate. This is dry and fresh, with a slightly lemony finish. Drink soon."

"A blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this is red-fruit driven on the nose, with shades of tobacco and rubber. The palate brings a bit more depth in flavors of blackberry, cranberry and leather, yet ultimately this is light in feel from racy acidity and soft, sandy tannins. A slightly bitter dusting of cocoa powder marks the close."
"A rather neutral nose offers glimpses of pear and lemon. The palate is also reticent but the pear fruit it shows is fresh, clean and edged with zesty lemon. This is light, dry and fresh."
"Tropical fruit and apple aromas are ripe and nice. This wine is fruity but imprecise on the tongue, with bold orange and apple flavors that are juicy, bright and fairly potent. Drink now."
"This biodynamic grower and producer makes distinctive wines that require a bit of a palate adjustment for some tasters. Here, there are some funky earthy aromas suggesting compost and barnyard, with flavors following. There is little of the fresh bright fruit flavors one might associate more commonly with Oregon Pinots, but plenty of complexity, length and a light touch of new French oak."
"Lovely spicy fruit stands out here and sets this apart from many of the winery's offerings. Concentrated ripe cranberry and plum flavors come with some bite to them, in a good way. The supporting acids have a citrus character, and the clean fruit continues on through a satisfying finish."
"Aromas of truffle, crushed herb, celery and wild berry slowly take shape on this. The medium-bodied elegant palate offers red cherry and baking spice notes alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2019."
"The Baga grape, a specialty of the Bairrada region, is traditionally known for its tannins. Here, in the hands of Dirk Niepoort from the Douro, it reveals a rounded, smoother character. The tannins are there although in a supporting role for the black fruits. Crisp, light and juicy, it's ready to drink from 2020"
"A rather closed nose hints at lemon. The palate has lemon freshness but lacks a little focus. Nonetheless this is fresh and clean, with an appetizing citrus note on the dry finish."

"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this has delicate aromas of black plum and baking spice. The dense palate offers prune, espresso and cedar alongside close-grained, rather astringent tannins."
"Made entirely with Alicante, this presents aromas suggesting red-skinned berry, white pepper and leather. The easygoing palate offers cranberry, clove and exotic spice alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
"This is Riesling for acid lovers; it screams out for freshly shucked oysters. Bone dry, quite tart, it's right on the edge of sour, with freshly squeezed lemon flavors in abundance. When matched to the right food, it should be a home run."
"This Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc blend offers aromas of ripe blackberry and baking spice. The round, soft palate evokes black cherry jam, vanilla and star anise alongside lithe tannins."
"This is a soft, juicy and approachable wine, in full grasp of grapey cherry flavors that veer overtly fruity. Medium bodied, it's a nice choice for the table, indoors or out."

"Cranberry and wild strawberry aromas lead on the nose of this Rosato. Creamy in feel, with a healthy vein of acidity, the palate brings flavors of herbs and watermelon. Soft tannins offer support and help extend the finish."
"This is a clonal mixPommard, Wdenswil, Dijon 115 and 777with leathery aromas around candied-fruit flavors. Ginger cookies and intense baking spices dominate, although the leathery character somewhat diminishes the fruit and dampens down the finish."
"Sticking closely with the winery's style of forward fruity spicy wines, this has a burst of strawberry and raspberry flavors, backed with juicy acids and baking spices. There's a slightly chalky quality to the finish."
"The closed nose has an earthy tint. On the palate this gives way to a pithy note of lemon and a bright, sunny freshness. This is light, fresh and has a superclean, dry finish."

"This unusual wine is a bright strawberry shade and offers intense aromatics and flavors of strawberries and ripe cherries. It was fermented on the skins for 14 days, and one-quarter of the total was whole cluster. This is a tasty wine with some citrus snap to the finish."
"Dark strawberry, black plum, fennel pollen, tarragon and a hint of caramel show on the nose of the solid second vintage for this memorably labeled bottle. Ripe purple fruit meets with minty spices on the palate, where the richness is cut by directed acidity."

"Sharp, racy and precise, this particular clone of Pinot Blanc is a rarity anywhere, especially in Oregon. Brisk apple and white-peach fruit comes with a scent of lemon verbena. The finishing tannins have a grainy expression. This would tuck in well with foods usually accompanied by a Loire Valley dry white wine."

"Elton is a new label under the Willamette Valley Vineyards umbrella, though the vineyard has been a favored designate for the past decade. This latest release offers pretty scents of red fruits. Along with those flavors come some bitter stem components, and a whiff of compost. The tannins at this age remain stiff and hard."

Pithy green apple and pear take center stage on the palate, which shows some textural weight and vibrant acidity."
"Aromas lean into the green, with notes of savory garden herb along with dark raspberry and plum. The plum flavors are plump with a lightly scratchy feel to the tannins. There's intrigue but it seems a bit underripe and leafy."
"This wine has aromas and flavors of black currant, cassis, fennel, cedar, dark chocolate and forest floor. A welcome barnyard note goves it a hint of rusticity. Decent acidity and velvety tannins make way for a long and woody finish."

Smoke, woodspice and cedar aromas are in front of fresh-chopped herb, green pepper and black raspberry, with green-olive notes lurking in the background. The palate is light but juicy, with coffee and cherry flavors that bring a slight sense of astringency. Citric acidity lingers on the finish."

"A rather earthy nose leads onto the fresh, slender and balanced palate. The body has a kind of rustic simplicity, with honest, clean red-cherry fruit. This is easy and fresh and would be ideal for a country-style lunch. Drink soon."
"Fully 70% was fermented whole cluster in neutral oak, yielding a wine with bright cranberry and raspberry fruit, juicy acids, and a touch of citrus. The wine avoids excessive stemmy flavors, though a bit of cardboard comes out in the tannins."
"Earthy, herbal aromas are a bit murky and reflect a marginal Toro vintage in 2014. A grabby, overextracted palate delivers rock-hard tannins along with gummy flavors of blackberry and blueberry. On the finish, creamy oak takes on a clove-like flavor."
"This Merlot brings a lot of aromas and flavors to the table, with tones of baked red and black fruits, nutmeg, clove and balsamic. The tannins are silky and the acidity gives a fresh lift to the feel."

"This is principally Syrah and Merlot, with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux grapes in the mix. It's fruity, fresh and flavorful, with berries and cherries in abundance, along with scents and flavors of smoke and roasted coffee. Call it a fine, gulpable, everyday red."
"There's a decent serving of thyme and sagebrush on the nose of this affordable bottling alongside the piquant raspberry and cranberry fruit, with a touch of wet earth in the background. The decently weighted palate shows cranberry and more dried herbs, gaining complexity toward the finish."
"Pinot Noir is most often done in a rounder fruitier style in Southern Oregon, and this pins the tail on that characteristic. It's a sturdy, blocky and tasty winea bit tannic, with flavors of black cherry, dried herbs and a lick of espresso."
"The price and special designation suggest that this is considered a reserve-level cuve. It seems quite dry, even astringent, with tea-flavored tannins around thin berry fruit. There are hints of mint, wintergreen and chocolate, but the wine doesn't show much depth. Perhaps more bottle age is needed. Two bottles were tasted with comparable notes."
"Red cherry and blackberry aromas meld with snippets of baking spice and menthol on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is firm, with structured tannins and crisp acidity, housing juicy berry flavors dotted with red floral tones. Dark plum rounds out the finish."
"A blend of 45% Sangiovese, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot, this has delicate aromas of tilled soil and black-skinned berry. The firm palate offers black-currant jam, tobacco and leather alongside closed-grained tannins."
"Just a touch of red cherry fruit show on the nose. The palate is light and slender but fresh in feel, with smooth, unobtrusive tannins. This will work well chilled. Drink soon."
"The nose offers lemon zest and green pear, two tones that also dominate the light, fresh and dry body which has a pithy textural side. Wonderfully clean and refreshing."
"The name identifies this as the winery's Internet-only cuve, and it has much the same character as the Uncarved Block Pinot. Rhubarb and tart strawberry fruit, low alcohol, and an overall balance emulate the lighter style of Pinot."
"Gamy, roasted aromas of berry fruits and black olive are less than stellar for a great year like 2010. A stewed, tomatoey palate is drawing in feel, while this Tempranillo from a single estate in Navarra tastes of olive and herbal black fruits. A severely tannic finish is rough and drying."
"While the nose on this dry Riesling is lavish, marked by plumes of white blossom and grapefruit zest, the palate is surprisingly restrained. Taut with lemon-lime acidity and a firm, steely backbone, it's a refreshing, spry wine with a moderately long finish."
"Broad black cherry aromas meet with soft touches of rosewater, star anise and hibiscus on this rather light bottling. It's very fresh on the palate, with lively pomegranate and berry flavors, though not much of the dark spice or tannic depth expected of the grape."
"A touch of pear peel is joined by a fresh lemon aroma on the nose. The palate offers a crisp lemon flavor that brightens the light, dry and easy-drinking body. Drink soon."
"The high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine brings out both tannins and black-currant fruit. It is firm and structured with layers of acidity and judicious wood-aging flavors. It is likely to age well, and should be ready to drink from 2023."
"From vines in the Entre-deux-Mers region, this ripe wine, with its 80% Merlot, is young with firm tannins that need to soften. It has plenty of ripe berry fruits laced with acidity and a dry core of tannins. Drink from 2019."
"This offers delicate scents of spring blossom, white stone fruit and a whiff of bread crust. On the vivacious palate, vigorous bubbles and bright acidity frame yellow apple, chopped herb and tangerine zest."
This blend of three local grapes including Albario opens with briny core aromas surrounded by white-fruit notes. The palate hits with a piercing shot of acidity but then turns thicker and more syrupy. Flavors of passion fruit and nectarine are slightly briny and finish plump.
"The nose isn't very expressive but the palate offers mature yellow apple, bread crust and citrus alongside a note of honeyed nut. Bright acidity and small bubbles refresh the finish."
"In the village of Arcins, in the heart of the Haut-Mdoc, this estate belongs to the Castel family, one of the largest drinks companies in France. This wine, with its generous tannins and ripe blackberry fruit, is easy, generous and likely to age well and quickly. Its tannic structure is fully integrated into the fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2023."
"This wine from an 11-acre property is soft and ripe, with plenty of ripe berry fruits. Hints of the 18 months in wood are still there although they are not at all obtrusive. It is an easy wine just touched by spice, and will be ready to drink by 2018."
"Vineyards in the Press family's 450-acre estate surround one of the Mdoc's grand chateaus owned by Bordeaux elite over centuries. The wine from 155 planted acres has been spiced with 12 months in wood, giving a toasty character to the juicy black-currant fruit. It is a structured wine, ripe and with good potential. Drink from 2022."
"The 39-acre estate is under the same ownership as Chteau les Trois Manoirs. This wine has a generous use of wood that has nicely stopped short of smothering the fruit. While the wine offers plenty of spice and toast, it also offers juicy black currants and acidity. The two elements are coming together and the wine will be ready from 2023."
"This estate in the northern vineyards of Bordeaux is planted to a blend of 75% Merlot and the two Cabernets. The wine has structure as well as rich berry fruits. Its tannins mark it out as still young, and this potentially ripe, warm wine should be drunk from 2019."
"This spicy, toasty has the potential for bright berry fruits. With acidity as well as a dry structure, it will need aging. This family estate dates back to the 19th century. Drink from 2023."
"This light, fruity wine already has a good balance between bright fruits and the wood-aging. With black-currant flavors from the 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and spice from the 12 months wood aging, this wine is still structured and will be best from 2021."
"This spicy, juicy wine has black-currant fruitiness from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. It is rich, the wood aging still showing in the toasty edge. With its lively fruit and soft tannins, it will develop well over the medium term. Drink from 2020."
"Owned by the Cruse family, one of Bordeaux's major negociants, this estate was their original purchase in Bordeaux. With more than 60% of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this wine is packed with black currants and tannins in equal measure. As the wine softens, it will broaden out to emphasize its richness and the warm fruit. Drink from 2023."
"A blend holding 55% Cabernet Sauvignon gives plenty of black currant fruit and provides the tannins that form the background to this richly juicy wine. Merlot adds weight to this perfumed, ripe wine that will be ready to drink from 2019."
"This wine is generous, with red-berry and red-currant fruitiness. Its tannins still show some firmness although they are integrating well with the fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink by mid-2018."
"This estate lies in the far western reaches of the Mdoc close to the forest, giving a cool character to the wine. It obviously been wood-aged, although with room left for the blackberry fruits. Spice and toast flavors are already integrating well, indicating the wine's potential. Drink from 2023."
"This structured wine comes from an estate that has records going back to the 13th century. A blend of half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is firm and tannic at this young stage. The juicy black currant fruit is beginning to develop, bringing with it plenty of crisp acidity. Drink this wine from 2023."
"Yellow wildflower, bread crust and chamomile aromas lead the way. The bright foaming palate offers mature yellow apple, orange rind and toasted walnut alongside a fun lively mousse."
A perfumed cloud of rose petals hovers over the glass and beneath that is a touch of earthiness. The palate is surprisingly light and translucent but utterly rose-scented. This is off-dry but finishes a little short.
"A rather neutral nose merely hints at some citrus and pear. The palate is more forthcoming with fresh, lively lemon that frames ripe pear. This is juicy, balanced and refreshing, with a dry and fruity finish. Drink soon."
"A hint of ripe pear can be discerned on the closed nose. The palate is clean and fresh, with just a little texture. This is an easy, light and dry wine. Enjoy soon."
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and underbrush. The firm palate offers black plum, vanilla and cocoa alongside velvety tannins."
"Smoke and caramel accent fresh peach, lime and lemon in this sweet-tart kabinett. Light in body and offering a delicate concentration, it's a spry, racy wine with a refreshing finish. Drink now through 2020."
"Warmly fruity, this is among the most immediately satisfying of the winery's 2015 Pinots. The berry and cherry flavors carry a light streak of cola, and the tight acids bring a hint of orange juice. Drink now through the early 2020s."
"An opulent nose of cabbage, ginger and buttery oak aromas sets up for a palate that is slightly less in your face. It boasts bright acidity but is nevertheless rich and creamy, with a rather large smudge of oak. One for the full-bodied Chard lovers."
"Sanguine and bitter in dried herb, this is a thick dense wine, explosive on the palate in juicy black cherry and berry. The finish is a tad harsh in tannin."
"All of Helioterra's white wines are immaculate, fresh and framed with crisp, clean acids. This brings tightly-focused flavors of lemon and star fruit, with a sprinkling of caraway through the persistent finish."
"A rather neutral nose just hints at freshness. The dry palate is light in feel, with lemon and pear flavors. Overall this is light, off-dry and fruity."
"This is a giant of a wine, from the heady, dried-fruit aromas to the flavors soaked in espresso and blackberry syrup to the thick blanket of tannin that wraps it all up. It is very full bodied, feels warm on the palate and leaves an astringent aftertaste."
"Johan grows biodynamically farmed grapes, and generally employs such techniques as native yeast and minimal intervention. The wines, as is the case here, tend to be quite low in alcohol. This offers precise flavors of wild berry, accented with allspice and a toasty note from aging in 30% new French oak."
"A touch of ripe, red cherry on the nose becomes fully expressed on the palate where it is met with freshness and a conifer tone. The tannins are fine and have the slightest crunch, while the body is light and translucent. This is fresh-faced, honest and clean."
"Aged in neutral French oak, this offers intriguing, slightly funky aromas of lemon verbena, green-apple skin and mineral that lead to sleek green- and red-apple flavors backed by racy acidity."
"The nose offers intense aromas of orange peel, dried apricot, marmalade and ginger, which carries to the palate along with fresh brioche. It feels creamy and round, with a supple body lending itself to a long, opulent finish."
"A tart but aromatic tone of cranberry hovers on the nose and then continues to fill the palate with its tart, appetizing purity. This is a very light, slender wine that offers ample freshness. Drink soon."
"Oily, briny, waxy aromas reflect aging and extended time on lees, both of which this wine has been through. Piercing acidity keeps things in balance, while oxidized flavors of corn and salted peach finish strong and slightly bitter. This unique style of Albario is not for everyone."
"Aromas of French oak, coconut and baked plum lead the nose. The chewy palate offers raspberry compote, prune, licorice, grilled sage and oak-driven flavors alongside close-grained tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish. You'll also notice the warmth of evident alcohol."
"Aromas of moist soil, underbrush, leather and a whiff of eucalyptus take shape on this. Taut and racy, the linear palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, powdered sage and a hint of clove set against vibrant acidity. Tight, rather grainy tannins grip the close."
"Grassy and herbaceous, as befits this variety, you'll want to drink this zesty, lively wine while it's at its freshest. Peppery and pungent, it's a good stand-in for an inexpensive Loire Valley Sauv Blanc."
"From a property owned by the Bouey family since 1998, this wine is generous, ripe and offers attractive black-currant fruitiness. A blend led by 70% Merlot, it is soft and rounded, with a core of tannins for a bit of aging. Drink from 2021."
"Raspberry and pomegranate rise above aromas of white pepper and herbs. Tart cranberry, cedar and vanilla flavors are supported by chalky tannins and a vibrant vein of acidity, finishing on notes of cedar and raspberry."
"Perfumed in black cherry and smoky oak, this is a robust, richly ripe red, meaty and brawny in leather and blackberry jam."
"This is a value wine, thick in resolved tannin and a density of tart cassis and red and black currant. Dried herb and earthy graphite elements give it varietal character and a brightness against the weight."
"This wine is soft, gently textured and ripely fruity. Citrus and apple flavors are lifted by attractive acidity and the wine ready to drink young. The aftertaste has spice and fresh acidity. Drink now."
"Named for a parcel of vines in the Sbio vineyard, this wine is perfumed, with aromatic fruit and a zesty texture. Lychees and spice are an important part of this ripe, rounded wine. Drink now."
"A saturated, grapy nose with jammy black-fruit aromas is massive but not exact. A blocky, clumsy palate is weighty and a touch stewed. Blackened berry flavors show every bit of this Garnacha-based wine's 15% abv. Notes of fig and chocolate are up front on a heavy finish."
"Correctly labeled medium sweet, this low alcohol, fruit-driven wine shows honeysuckle and apricot flavors principally, with a touch of tea. The sugar is offset with ample acidity, maintaining balance and precision, and keeping it in the ballpark to pair with spicy noodle dishes."
"Vibrant in aromas of peach, guava and watermelon, these notes carry to a creamy palate that boasts lively acidity to balance. A crushed mineral note offers further levity on the finish."
"Light in color, this offers faint aromas that give up almost nothing on first pour, except notes of spice. Still young, the palate is more revealing, showing elegant flavors of raspberry and plum. If the aromas open up it could move up a notch."
"Bold and oaky, this full-bodied wine layers wood smoke and butter aromas over baked pear and almond flavors, while hints of new oak run through it. The wine has a mouth-coating texture and tastes warm and spicy on the finish."
"This opens with earthy aromas suggesting forest floor, toast, scorched soil and a whiff of game. The palate shows dried black cherry, licorice and powdered sage alongside assertive, grainy tannins that grip the finish."
"There's a nice vitality to the nose of this wine, with aromas of lemon and grapefruit rinds alongside ripe tones of pear and apple. The palate shows equalthe same verve in ripe yellow apple flavors struck against a core of tangerine and chalk."
"While quiet on the nose, the palate of this juicy, easy drinking sptlese offers loads of ripe tangerine, pineapple and yellow-apple flavors. It's not a complex wine but revitalizing and crisp, with a pleasant hint of astringency lending structure to the finish. Drink now through 2020."
"Fresh and floral on the nose, the palate is ripe in red berry flavors, balanced by streaks of granite. Vibrant acidity helps cut through some of the fruit weight. This is simplistic but easy to glug."
"Oaky, rubbery aromas are stewy and include notes of clove and cinnamon. A raw, pulling palate is defined by rubbery tannins, while this wine is toasty on top of tart plum and black-currant flavors. A firm, tough finish holds leftover clove, toast and licorice flavors."
"Berry and tomato aromas are basic. Typical of Garnacha, this is grabby and chewy on the palate. Flavors of grape skins, black plum and herbal berry fruits are peppery and show a hint of oak-based clove on the finish."
Aromas of toasted bread crust and walnut follow through to the palate along with mature yellow apple skin and a hint of ripe lemon zest. An almond note gives it a bitter finish.
"Aromas of creamed corn, spice and baked apple lead to light, pleasant fruit flavors in this straightforward wine."
"On first take, this smells oaky, with notes of animal fur and earthy berry fruits. A tight palate shows tomatoey acidity, while a narrow field of flavors includes plum and herbs. Drawing tannins and a minty flavor drive the finish on this basic but positive Rioja."
"Pure and fresh notes of freshly cut Conference pear are immediately apparent. The same light, pure, fresh fruit plays on the slender, dry palate. This is an crowd-pleaser of a wine, with lovely balance."
"The nose is ripe in aromas of red cherry and berry tones, while the palate is less expressive but presents a juicy, easy freshness on a light body. This will also work chilled. Drink soon."
"This wine features a bouquet of white peach and pink grapefruit. It offers a nice balance of fruit and floral flavors, with grapefruit, lemon and jasmine."
"This opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, scorched soil and a hint of game. The firm palate offers black-currant jam, licorice and star anise alongside polished tannins."
"A blend of 60% Verdeca, 35% Bianco d'Alessano and 5% Minutolo, this is a snappy, enjoyable wine, with aromas of ripe apple, pear and dried hay that echo on the palate. This shows a waxy feel that is cut by lively acidity on the midpalate. Enjoy with white fish or ceviche."
"This wine shows a perfumed nose of lemon, rose water and orange zest. On the palate pithy citrus counters the rose petal softness. There is just the slightest edge of bitterness on the light and resolutely dry palate."
"This Cabernet Franc is abundant in aromasvacillating from greener notes of tomato leaf and spearmint to jammy red currant, black plum and violets. The racy acidity is much needed to match the full body. Smooth tannins are well integrated and the finish is long and mouthwatering."
"This blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Shiraz, 11% Merlot and 9% Petit Verdot offers massive black-plum character throughout the nose and mouth, as well as accents of black cherry, cassis, tobacco and woodspice. The medium tannins lend good grip to the palate, but resolve fairly quickly on the close. Notes of black currant leaf and fruit skin ride out the close. Enjoy now and through 2020."
"Underripe strawberry and watermelon tones carry the nose and palate, with Mediterranean shrubs in the background. Medium in weight, with a nice balance of acidity, cranberry-skin tannins offer support from start to finish."
"Jammy red fruit aromas mix with floral and sweet spice undertones on the nose. Medium in weight, with gentle acidity, the palate bursts with red berry flavors and notes of anise and mint."
"A touch shy upon first sniff, this wine opens up more with time to reveal bright aromas of brambly berry, raspberry and cherry, all hit by a decent dusting of cinnamon. The medium-weight palate is straightforward and approachable, with moderate tannins and a mouthwatering finish that leaves the palate refreshed. Drink now."
"Mango, cantaloupe and lychee shine on the nose, with subtler hints of grass and peach blossom. This wine is simple and pleasant in its flavors of melon, orange zest and fresh cut grass, ending on a juicy orange note."
"Cantaloupe and stone-fruit aromas of this Trepat-based Cava are clean but basic. That also describes the palate, which is good but a bit soft and low on acidity, with some dry orange flavors."
"A very reductive take on the grape, this bottling shows lawn cuttings, guava skin, tangy green orange pith on the nose, but also hints of an oily underlying structure. Those aromas come together on the palate, with dried grass and citrus skins proving rather pungent."
"Pear and melon aromas are good but basic. Citric acidity is grabbing, while citrus and peach flavors show a hint of green pepper on the backside. On the finish, the fruit character doesn't last long. Drink immediately."
Aromas of charred wood and black pepper meet concentrated flavors of black cherry and blackberry in this full-bodied wine. A hint of sweetness rounds its edges on the palate and gives a jammy note to the finish.
"Barrel fermented in 20% new French oak, using indigenous yeasts, this is soft and supple, with a sense of impending oxidation. Bruised apples and pears constitute the fruit, and it should be consumed over the next year or two."
"Medicinal, rubbery aromas suggest earthy berry, compost and latex. This Grenache-Carignan-Syrah blend feels baked and chunky but not fully defined. Roasted dark-berry flavors finish heavy and without finesse."
"Bright aromas of strawberry, lavender, violets and rooibos are met with cedar and ginger. These carry through to the palate where an element of charred wood is introduced. Ample acidity and a mid-weight body offer a nice mouthfeel and a long, woody finish."
"A wealth of oak toneswood, vanilla and cocoaride over a core of cherry jam. The full-bodied palate follows suit, with pillowy tannins and mild acidity giving just enough support. The oak sticks out a bit, but beneath that layer is a rich fruity core."
"Solid plum and berry aromas lead to a fruity palate that's bouncy but not deep or layered. Candied berry flavors are satisfactory, but kind of basic. A flush finish closes out this varietal Monastrell."
"Made with 60% Sangiovese and 40% Alicante, this opens with aromas of leather, baking spice and a hint of violet. The easygoing palate suggests red cherry, raspberry jam and star anise alongside smooth tannins."
"Pleasing aromas of spiced bramble, anise and dark flowers give a good start to this wine. Medium in weight, with a mix of ripe and tart berries, this wine is well-balanced and well-structured but simplistic in its profile."
"Attractive in underripe peach and spry lemon aromas, the medium-bodied palate shows juicy melon and stone fruit flavors balanced by lemon-lime acidity. This is a crisp, refreshing Chardonnay, perfect for simple enjoyment."
"This wine is straightforward and rich in ripe tropical fruit aromas and flavors. Well-balanced acidity helps maintain freshness on the medium-bodied palate, leading to a crisp, clean finish."
"This has subdued aroma suggesting forest floor, leather and a whiff of menthol. The light-bodied palate offers tart sour cherry, cranberry and a note of dark culinary spice alongside racy acidity."
"Woody berry aromas are hot but also creamy and show vanilla notes. A bold, grabby palate delivers oaky flavors of prune, spice and chocolate. Some heat and aggressiveness must be dealt with on a firm finish."
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, ripe apricot and butterscotch while the textured palate offers cedar, vanilla and lemon drop. It closes on a note of bitter almond."
"Whiff of wild berry, moist earth and chopped herb aromas merge with a blue flower note. Suggestions of the nose carry over to the light-bodied delicate palate along with a hint of ground pepper. Bright acidity and dusty, not very persistent tannins provide gauzy support. Drink soon."
"Intriguing notes of curing spice, game, green pepper, coriander and cedar grace the black-fruit core of this Cab. The tannins are soft and approachable, while seductive notes of campfire and charred fruit skin unfold on the finish. Drink now."
"This is fresh, fruity and off dry, with a buttery smooth mouthfeel. There are mixed tree fruits and just enough acidity to offset the sweetness adequately. It's a perfect springtime sipping wine, low in alcohol, ripe with fruit flavor, and should be consumed over the next year or two."
"Fresh lemon juice freshens the richer aromas of butter cookie and caramelized sugar. The creamy mouthfeel gives way to bright, juicy pineapple, lemon curd and vanilla flavors, finishing crisp and fruity."
"Grown in the comparatively cool conditions of the plateau of Alij, this wine has a crisp, poised character. Its citrus fruits and touch of minerality give freshness and a good texture. Drink this bright wine now."
"Black fruit, dark lilacs and wet earth show on the nose of this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 24% Petit Verdot. Elderflower and elderberry flavors show on the sip, which is tight and sticky in texture and could use a little more mellowing."
"Restrained and earthy, this Sauvignon displays citrus peel and crushed stone aromas. The palate offers a bit more intensity and complexity, with grapefruit zest creating a focused line of acidity from start to finish."
"There's a density to the nose and palate that can't be ignored, which translates to a syrupy aroma and thick palate. There are some uplifting tones of herbs and savory cherry that offer levity, with brisk acidity and bolstering tannins giving support."
"Pure varietal and estate grown, this opens with concentrated, sweet berry preserves of strawberry and raspberry jam. It stiffens up in the middle as it moves into rather astringent, lightly earthy tannins."
"Despite the high alcohol, this is relatively restrained, with flavors mixing rosewater and raspberries. It's a simple, lightly fruity wine, with stiff tannins that introduce suggestions of black tea and a whiff of tobacco."
"This ripe wine, with its rich tannins and smooth texture, is delicious. Balanced and soft, it's a ripe blend of Tinta Roriz, Touriga Nacional and Jaen. With blackberry and black-currant flavors, it is fruity. It has no wood aging, although there's some final spice from the fruit. Drink now."
"This young wine is quite tight and tannic, with hard fruit flavors of red currant. Stemmy scents and flavors are out in full force, and this might well want another year or two in bottle before it's all pulled together. There's a finishing lick of ultra dark chocolate threaded through those chewy tannins."
"This is a straightforward yet not overly expressive Shiraz, with subtle notes of currant and plum skin on the nose and mouth. The structure is easy and approachable, with soft tannins and fruit-skin flavors that lend subtle grip through the licorice-laced finish. Drink now."
"The oak is far out front, with aromas of vanilla, shaved coconut, toast and freshly chopped wood, making it hard to get at the notes of dark fruit and herb. The flavors show fruit mixed with a heavy barrel influence, with the latter winning out on the finish."
"This affordable blend combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Zinfandel. Elusive and thick in concentrated black fruit and leather, it offers massive, assertive tannins and a lasting imprint of dried herb."
"This is a straight-ahead, electric red, slightly off-dry ros, made from Pinot Noir grapes. Red fruits with a spicy kick have plenty of fruit sweetness, though not necessarily residual sugar. Given that it's a 2015, it should be consumed as soon as possible."
"The nose wants to give almost nothing away. The palate, however, presents subtle green pear and yellow plum on a very slender, dry body."
"This rare native grape creates a wine that is enjoyable in primary fruit expression. Floral and spicy, with a wealth of red cherry and black berry flavors, this is light bodied but crisp, clean and perfect with a slight chill."
"Ripe red fruits dominate this soft wine. The fruitiness of Trincadeira is boosted by the firmer character of Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional, yielding a rich wine that is smooth and juicy, with spice and dark-coffee flavors. Drink now."
"This medium-bodied, dry and spicy-tasting wine has a relatively light color, aromas like cedar and cinnamon and lean cherry flavors. A definite touch of tannin adds grip to the mouthfeel."
"This wine is mostly Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Aromas of blueberry pie and huckleberry pop, showing grace notes of barrel spice and herb. The flavors are lighter in style, losing concentration in the middle and seeming watery, and never come back together."
"In terms of sheer hedonism, this is a successful wine, full of oaky aromas of vanilla cake, caramel and plum pudding, loaded with crme brle and ripe fruit flavors. But the oak winds up feeling single-noted by the finish, and the grape seems lost in the seasonings."
"Berry and spice aromas that suggest clove open this medium-bodied Garnacha. Spiced berry flavors hint at cinnamon, while chocolate notes are welcome on a plump finish."
Sauvignon Gris may be only 10% of the blend but it gives a delicious perfumed character to this wine. Grapefruit and apricot flavors combine with the mineral texture to give a rich while still taut wine. Drink from late 2018.
"This small 12-acre property has a high proportion of Merlot in its blends. Still packed with high-toast wood flavors, this wine has a future, with plenty of ripe red-berry fruits and a generous texture. Wait for the wood to dissipate and for the fruit to come forward."
"This wine is rich with sweetness although it shows only a light botrytis character. It has a touch of spice from the wood aging as well as honey and lemon to balance the sweetness and acidity. Even though young, it is ready to drink."
"Aromas of juicy black plums and raspberries meld with vanilla and sage on the nose. Loaded with flavors of vanilla and baked plums, the palate is plush in feel, with hints of raspberry, white pepper and oregano. Mellow acidity fades into the medium-length finish, showing soft notes of blackberry speckled with pepper."
"Bright, pleasant aromas of yellow apple, pear and papaya lead to a palate chock full of tropical-fruit flavors. It finishes a little tangy."
"Elton is a new label under the Willamette Valley Vineyards umbrella, though the vineyard has been a favored designate for the past decade. This latest release falls a little short. The barrel flavors of buttered nuts have a slightly oily mouthfeel, and the apple and orange fruit is only moderately ripened. It seems to promise more than it delivers, given the packaging and price."
"Fruity aromas of wild red berry and a whiff of moist soil lift out of the glass. On the restrained light-bodied palate, bright acidity and dusty, not very persistent tannins give sheer support to red cherry and a hint of white pepper. Drink soon."
"Underbrush, violet, aromatic herb and wild berry aromas appear at the forefront. The light-bodied palate is less expressive, showing dried blackberry and clove alongside dusty tannins."
"Exotically floral, this wine is extreme in spicy acidity and robust earthiness, a mix of rose petal, citrus and black tea that struggles somewhat to find balance and fruit."
"A nose of honeydew melon and vanilla bean set the stage for flavors of apple, nectarine and hazelnut. This wine is full on the palate, with closing notes of citrus fruit and a hint of toasted nuts."
"This blend of Riesling, Vidal Blanc and Seyval Blanc has soft aromas of elderflower, lemon, wet stone and dried apple. Zippy acidity tingles on the palate and lends itself to a long finish full of minerality."
"This wine is made from three barrels were chosen for their particular aroma and flavor characteristics. It carries aggressive, spicy cranberry flavors and searing acidity that cuts the palate short. Drink now."
"Exuberantly fruity and forward, this light-footed kabinett offers loads of sweet, juicy tangerine, grapefruit and berry flavors. It's not a complex wine but approachable and easy drinking, with a clean mineral finish."
"This playful, easy-drinking blend of 46% Shiraz, 31% Cinsault, 20% Mourvdre and 3% Grenache is ripe and fruit-forward, offering oodles of black plum, cherry and currant tones that are hit by accents of blackcurrant leaf and bramble. The juicy palate boasts soft tannins and bright acidity, resulting in a clean, mouthwatering finish. Drink now2019."
"From a chateau owned by the Bouey Bordeaux negociant family, this wine is ripe, rich and soft. Its tannic structure gives just-enough support to the attractive red-currant and berry fruits. Drink this forward, fruity wine from 2020."
"Aromas of mint, woodspice, raspberry and coffee are followed by ripe red-currant flavors. Soft, lightly grainy tannins provide support. It has good things going on and is varietally correct but seems a bit woody."
"Dry and astringent, this is remarkably similar to a hard cider. Half was fermented in stainless steel, half in concrete, and it is the concrete that comes out in the aromatics, much more than fruit. For food pairing, look to the sorts of things that would accompany a good cider."
"From Dijon clones, this shows dried cranberries and a touch of leather. The finish seems a bit attenuated also. Two bottles were tasted; the second a little less leathery, but with comparable fruit."
"The least expensive of the winery's Pinots, this has a light and fruity style that makes it instantly approachable. Simple red-berry flavors, crisp acids and a little crunch to the tannins give it some extra depth."
"An earthy overtone sits on the nose. The palate has a similarly earthy ring but adds gentle pear and lemon notes to a very light, dry body."
"Light rose buds, dried potpourri and tart cranberry aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend. The palate is a touch thin but with decent grip, and delivers easily likable flavors of cranberry and cinnamon."
"This wine is very fruity in flavor and almost sleek in texture, but still has the varietal's typical firm tannins and hints of black pepper in the generous black-cherry flavors. It's medium bodied, not too heavy or too astringent, so it will be more versatile than many."
"Aromas of toasted nut, bread crust and a whiff of grilled rosemary lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the palate along with yellow apple skin and a hint of coffee while brisk acidity gives it a rather lean finish."
"Earthy forest and mushroom belie a hearty, dense and velvety expression of rich dark cherry and huckleberry in this full-bodied powerful wine."
"Aromas of orange peel, melon and vanilla come together fairly well. This feels plump but solid, with modest acidity. Melony flavors turn yeasty on a lightly oxidized finish that lacks length and kick. Drink now."
"Despite the extra years in bottle, this wine has not really come together. Somewhat awkward and astringent, it pushes stiff berry fruits against drying tannins. Sometimes blending is a better approach than focusing too specifically on a single block and clone."
"This entry-level, simple yet well-made wine offers straightforward cranberry and cherry fruit. It's fresh and bright, with juicy youthful appeal. Drink now while it's at its freshest."
"Made from the regional grape of unknown origins, Minutolo, this wine is not bashful with its heady floral and fruity nature. Ripe tropical fruit, grapefruit and white flower tones carry the nose and palate. This is medium in weight with a delightfully astringent texture that helps maintain balance."
"A touch of cream joins the pear note on the nose. The palate, however, has a main theme of fresh lemon on a slender, dry body. Drink soon."
"The ocean is never far away in all wines from the Lisboa region. The crispness and the bright red fruits of this open wine testify to that fact. This is a light wine, full of fruit, delicious now and ready to drink."
"A tightly wound framework of bittersweet tannin and oak dominate in this mountainous red, which exhibits pencil shavings, cedar and sage around ripe full-bodied black cherry and plum."
"Aromas of ripe pear, yellow peach and medicinal herb follow over to the vibrant palate along with yellow apple and tangerine zest. Bright acidity gives it a crisp clean finish."
"Pleasing aromas of almond butter, lemon zest and kiwi lead to papaya, pineapple and other tropical-fruit flavors. It delivers immediate appeal."
"Lightly toasted apple, melon and guava form the core of this ripe and fruit-forward wine. It's light in body and style, with clean yet delicate acidity and a brisk close. Drink now."
"Citrus blossom, white stone fruit and medicinal herb aromas mingle with a whiff of bread crust. The invigorating palate shows Golden Delicious apple and nectarine rind balanced by lively acidity and racy bubbles. It closes on a walnut note."
"Lightly floral, this delicate but quite drinkable wine shows flavors of peavine, lime and pineapple. The fruit is just ripe enough, balanced and clean, with refreshing acidity."
"Superripe Merlot, 60% in this blend, gives this wine power and density, with full-bodied black fruit and firm tannins. Wood aging, partially in new wood, has brought in spice as well as a dry core that indicates the potential of this wine as it matures. Drink from 2023."
"This soft, juicy wine has ripe black-currant fruits and some smoky tannins. It is warm, generous and likely to mature quickly. Drink from 2020."
"Fresh red- and black-berry aromas are underscored by tilled earth on the nose. The palate is similar in character, boasting a ripe and juicy feel, with medium weight, light tannins and soft acidity. Drink now."
"Murky, gamy aromas indicate that 2014's wet, humid conditions affected this wine. In the mouth, this is heavy and tough, with grating tannins. Black-fruit flavors combined with lemony oak are chunky, massive and acidic on the finish. This wine is good but has balance issues."
"Fresh apple, orange and green melon are at the fore of this straightforward yet refreshing and tasty wine. It is light in weight and concentration, offering fruity flavors of apple and pear that finish bright and clean. Drink now."
Mirabelle plum and very ripe pear create a fruity expression on the nose. That same fruit is abundant on the palate. This is a fruity wine with a medium-dry finish.
"Subtle notes of yellow plum have an edge of freshness on the nose. The plum notes also pervade on the juicy, fruit-driven palate. This is light easy, dry and refreshing."
"Aromas of yellow peach, citrus and a whiff of almond carry over to the medium-bodied palate. Fresh acidity gives it a bright finish."
"Aromas of pear and lemon rise from the rather neutral nose. The palate comes in with far more fruit in notes of ripe apple and pear, with freshness and a creamy aspect. This is a fruity, easy, dry wine. Drink soon."
"Subdued notes of ripe, yellow pear play on the nose and palate. Freshness balances this beautifully, giving it a dry, crisp finish. Drink soon."
"Just a hint of cherry appears on the shy nose. On the fresh, light and translucent palate the fruit tone is pure but tart. This is fresh, honest and still has the slightest tannic grip. A very balanced, fresh-faced wine. Drink soon."
"The nose offers a touch of ripe pear. The palate shows less fruit and majors on a neutral but clean and balanced, dry body. This is simple but refreshing. Drink soon."
"Sweet herb, lime twist and peach aromas are followed by sleek, narrow citrus and stone-fruit flavors that drink off dry."
"Offering classic, varietal fruit flavors of apple and pear, this pleasant wine is lightly spiced and buoyed with supporting acids. It was finished in 5% new French oak."
"This seems to be quickly drying out, with fruit-leather flavors more than fresh berries and cherries. There's ample acidity and stiff tannins. Best to consume this as soon as possible."
"Restrained aromas of crushed mineral, apple and lemon turn ripe and sunny on the palate. Delicately sweet, it's an approachable, briskly balanced wine that finishes on a vibrant tangerine note. Drink now through 2019."
"This is stylish and youthfully fresh and tasty. Fermented in cement and aged for 10 months in neutral oak, it's got ripe spicy berry and plum flavors, just a touch high toned. Drink now through 2019."
"Produced by the winemaking team of Chteau Giscours in Margaux, this crisply herbal wine has great citrus and ripe yellow fruits and a rich, creamy texture. It is ready to drink."
"All the winery's wines are 100% varietal, and this is a solid effort with substantial flavors of mulberry and blackberry fruit. There's a streak of cola and lightly earthy tannins. Flavors are broad and accessible, and the wine finishes with a streak of vanilla."
This is a rich red-fruit-dominated wine. Berries and acidity combine with light tannins to give a wine that bursts from the glass. Enjoy this attractively fruity wine soon.
"From the new venture from major producer Sogrape, this wine is soft and juicy, with attractive red fruits. Its acidity and gentle tannins are balanced with the refreshing fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink."
"Aromas of pollen, wildflower honey and peach are enticing on the nose. This off-dry wine is ripe yet balanced, with flavors of orange, peach and juicy mango. The ripe melon finish is charming and clean."
"There's an intriguing levity to the nose of this this wine in its pressed violet, mint and wild strawberry aromas. Medium in weight, with solid tannic grip, the palate offers more of the same, yet ends on a chalky, mineral finish."
Rock manager turned winemaker Sheri Hood honors some old-school rockers (the band MC5) with this affordable Pinot. Boysenberry and plum fruits come along with stiff earthy tannins. For the modest price it has plenty of flavor and some muscle as well.
"Barrel aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, dill, toast and baking spice, along with a light meaty note. The flavors show a luscious, velvety feel, with the oak influence running quite high."
"This variety is unheard of in the appellation. Quite pale in color with an orange tinge, the aromas bring notes of macerated cranberry and cherry, along with a vanilla note that gives the impression of confection. The palate brings lighter-styled fruit flavors, with the oak taking over on the back half. The tannins are quite light for the variety. It's intriguing but doesn't seem varietal."
"Oaky vanilla and sweet spice overpower apricot and lemon aromas on the nose. A rich vanilla tone leads flavors of mango, apricot, and mandarin on the palate. The mouthfeel is soft, with balancing acidity and a clean vanilla and apricot finish."
"An austere wine, this does not shy away from flavors of stem, beet root and rhubarb. The fruit touches on strawberry, but does not display the ripe flavors you might anticipate from the listed alcohol. It's high acid, herbal and earthy."
"Fresh and leesy, this all-stainless wine has cucumber, apple and green-melon flavors, done in a light tart refreshing style. Drink up."
"Another barrel selection, this seems quite thin in comparison with the rest of the winery's 2013s. It's tart and acidic, without the supporting detail and overall elegance of the rest. There are simple fruit flavors of citrus and sour berries."
"This is a nice, juicy wine that has interesting fruit and earth aromas, good ripe berry flavors and an easy-going texture. It feels medium bodied and tastes not too strong and not too weak."
"This full-bodied wine is loaded with aromas of pear nectar and grilled baguette, and very ripe fruit flavors. It has a warmly oaky personality, showing vanilla and coconut in addition to generous pear notes."
Interesting bay leaf and clove aromas are followed by focused and bright black-cherry flavors and a vivid texture shaped by firm acidity and moderate tannins. It has a lean and lively feel and no oakiness.
"Aromas of dark fruit, smoked meat and herb lead to plentiful plum flavors that miss a bit in the middle. It comes up short on the finish but otherwise provides appeal."
"This opens with aromas of red berry, underbrush, mint and leather. The palate is more straightforward, offering blackberry, powdered sage and hints of baking spice set against bright acidity and dusty, not very persistent tannins."
"Effusive aromas of strawberry and raspberry lead to rich, equally fruity flavors and a velvety texture that balances some tannin with a touch of ripeness. It's a full-bodied, mouth-coating and smooth blend."
"Dusty aromas suggest apple. A full, round palate is soda-like and not precise, while this tastes of lightly spiced apple with a dusting of powdered sugar. A short, mellow finish is nondescript."
"The 67% of Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it both richness and a firm structure. It is a solid wine, still showing its oak aging but with juicy fruit and acidity. It will develop as it softens, so drink from 2022."
"Medium straw in color, this wine features aromas of apple and honeysuckle. It is tart at first sip, with flavors of lemon-lime and Gala apple that are slowly overtaken by strong notes of eucalyptus. Fruit flavors return on the finish, offering a closing note of pear."
"This wine is tannic and dusty, a big, dense expression of a formidable grape that leers into smoky, dark and brooding territory. Blackberry and cherry drip from an herbal backdrop of intensity."
"A number of wineries draw upon grapes from this excellent site. Here, the flavors are of cranberries and raspberries, and remain tart and rather acidic. The tannins are stiff and leave a slightly bitter aftertaste."
"Solid, at first seeming to be a bit on the chunky side, this thins out in the mouth, offering tart berry fruit. Along with that come some stemmy components and tannins that are just hitting not-quite-ripe flavors. It's a sound, but not distinguished, estate selection."
"Unusual aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher, lime zest and white flower are followed by light flower and peach flavors that finish tart. It doesn't all come together."
"Red berry, toast and underbrush aromas mingle with a whiff of eucalyptus. The tightly wound, austere palate offers sour cherry, espresso and a hint of star anise set against grainy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2021."
"This blend of 90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera is bright in red currant and red cherry aromas, with dustings of saw dust and anise. Medium in weight and displaying lively acidity, the palate is racy and streamlined in crisp red-fruit flavors under a layer of vanilla."
"Apple peel, grapefruit and riper tropical fruit notions meld with a floral background in this light-bodied, crisp wine. The concentration is light, yet what's there is quite enjoyable."
"Delicate hints of yellow cherry and apple sweeten this uncomplicated but fresh wine. Off dry in style, it's pleasantly sweet and tart on a zesty lemonade finish. Drink now."
"Ripe red fruits combine into a pleasant, though generic style. There's a touch of earth underlying the tannins, and a high-toned edge to the aromatics."
"From the more experimental side of the Craft Wine Company, this ros blends St. Laurent, Zweigelt, Blaufrnkisch and Grner Veltliner. The result is a pretty but somewhat dilute ros, with thinnish raspberry fruit, rosewater and a touch of neutral wood. It's fully mature and should be consumed in the near term."
"Crisp raspberry and red cherry flavors are invigorating and fresh on the palate of this easy-drinking, juicy Pinot Noir. It's delicate in concentration and light in body but balanced by soft but pleasantly bitter tannins. A hint of vanilla lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2020."
"This blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional and Petit Verdot is smooth, ripe and full of black-cherry and plum fruits. With its acidity, crisp texture and soft tannins, it will be ready to drink from mid-2018."
This is a good but basic ros Cava. Aromas of mild citrus fruits and vanilla lead to a good but basic palate with just enough energy and acidity. Cantaloupe and citrus-peel flavors are steady on the finish.
"Except for a hint of lime, this basic brut Cava smells neutral. A simple palate is citrusy and in solid shape. Generic white-fruit flavors come with mild green notes of celery and scallion. It's lively but lacks flavor on the finish."
"This wine is fresh and forward, with simple but appealing flavors of raspberry and cherry candies. The flavors don't go any further than that, but for a fruity quaffable wine, it's quite well done."
"This has a funky nose of truffle, game, scorched soil and just a whiff of barnyard. The fleshy palate has a rustic allure, showing baked plum, blackberry extract, vanilla and the same truffle and gamy notes of the nose. Grainy dusty tannins provide the soft framework."
"Aromas of ripe red berries and violets are fresh and light on the nose. A juicy, medium-bodied palate of blackberry and racy cranberry flavors shows good concentration, with floral accents that dot the finish."
"This ripe wine is full of black fruit as well as a serious tannin structure. Rich, concentrated, juicy with berry flavors and with layers of acidity, it strikes a balance between firm tannins and black fruit."
"This is a velvety thick and oaky red, aged some time in bottle. Somewhat herbal in clove, cedar and graphite notes, its texture is defined more by leather."
"This Bordeaux-style blend is comprised of mainly Cabernet Franc and rounded out with Merlot and Petit Verdot. This wine offers black currant, black plum and pepper, with additions of toasty clove, nutmeg and charred wood. Barnyard and fig bring depth of character to the mix. The acidity is bright and the tannins are present but soft. The finish is long and full of oak spice."
"Sourced from both Volcano Ridge and The Pines vineyards, this is a smooth, supple wine, 100% varietal, with a mix of plum and blueberry fruit. Somewhat high toned and bright, it is ready to drink over the next couple of years."
"There's a warm, ripe character to this wine, which boasts generous waves of macerated berries and cherries throughout. Accents of licorice, star anise and curing spice lend interest to the round, creamy palate. It's an easy, fruity pour that's best enjoyed now."
"There's the slightest pink tint to the color of this bottling, which shows baked apple and poached pear aromas on the ripe but pleasant nose. The palate is also quite ripe, showing more cooked pome fruit and squeezed lime, with a decent texture."
"This bottling is very mellow and shy on many fronts, though it emerges from its shell with patience. Light aromas of red fruit and dark spice lead into a palate with a full mouthfeel, carrying flavors of raspberry, rose petal, loam and eventually sharp baking spice."
"This is a nice, juicy wine that has interesting fruit and earth aromas, good ripe berry flavors and an easy-going texture. It feels medium bodied and tastes not too strong and not too weak."
"This full-bodied wine is loaded with aromas of pear nectar and grilled baguette, and very ripe fruit flavors. It has a warmly oaky personality, showing vanilla and coconut in addition to generous pear notes."
Interesting bay leaf and clove aromas are followed by focused and bright black-cherry flavors and a vivid texture shaped by firm acidity and moderate tannins. It has a lean and lively feel and no oakiness.
"Aromas of dark fruit, smoked meat and herb lead to plentiful plum flavors that miss a bit in the middle. It comes up short on the finish but otherwise provides appeal."
"This opens with aromas of red berry, underbrush, mint and leather. The palate is more straightforward, offering blackberry, powdered sage and hints of baking spice set against bright acidity and dusty, not very persistent tannins."
"Effusive aromas of strawberry and raspberry lead to rich, equally fruity flavors and a velvety texture that balances some tannin with a touch of ripeness. It's a full-bodied, mouth-coating and smooth blend."
"Dusty aromas suggest apple. A full, round palate is soda-like and not precise, while this tastes of lightly spiced apple with a dusting of powdered sugar. A short, mellow finish is nondescript."
"The 67% of Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it both richness and a firm structure. It is a solid wine, still showing its oak aging but with juicy fruit and acidity. It will develop as it softens, so drink from 2022."
"Fruit-forward aromas of black currant and plum lead to plump, easy-drinking fruit flavors. It's straightforward, though it seems to lack concentration, especially in the middle."
"Baked licorice leads the nose on this blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc, along with thyme and stewed elderberries. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied, carrying flavors of exotic marjoram and red currant."
"The nose is closed and does not want to give too much away. The palate, however, has lovely lemon and fresh pear fruit on a rather light, dry body. This is fresh, easy and fairly neutral, but clean and fresh. Drink soon."
"Fruit-forward aromas of black currant and plum lead to plump, easy-drinking fruit flavors. It's straightforward, though it seems to lack concentration, especially in the middle."
"A neutral nose offers a quiet, lemony streak. The palate is equally neutral, almost dilute, but fresh and clean. Some apple and pear notes appear on the refreshing finish. Drink soon."
"A blend of 60% Primitivo and 40% Negroamaro, this shows a mix of spiced blackberry and cranberry aromas under a sheen of toasted oak. The medium-bodied palate is well structured with juicy acidity and medium-grained tannins, and is rounded out by soft, ripe berry flavors."
"This blend of Primitivo and Negroamaro is linear in its expression of ripe cherry, baking spice and graphite. The medium-bodied palate starts juicy up front, but dries out as it reaches the tense, plum-skin finish."
"Forward vivid scents of cranberry and raspberry introduce similar fresh fruit flavors, backed by slightly harsh notes of skin and stem. It's a sturdy serviceable effort, which finishes with a hint of chicken broth."
"This wine's aromas include notes of yellow apple, melon and lees. The palate brings a rounded feel, showing little apparent new-oak influence. It's a straightforward, varietally correct wine."
"Aged in wood for 12 months, this blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon is already balanced and stylish. Its wood aging has added spice without masking any of the black-currant fruit. Drink this wine from 2019"
"Produced in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, this wine is rich, young and fruity. And that's the way it should be, because this is not a wine for aging but for enjoying with its black fruits and ripe texture. Drink from mid-2018."
"Named after the stagecoach that used to stop here on its way up the Mdoc, this wine is light, with soft blackberry fruits and acidity. An easy wine that's likely to mature quickly, it should be ready from 2019."
"A mix of black and red cherries carry the nose, with tobacco leaf and herbal spice tones in a more moderate concentration. There's levity to the mouthfeel from the crisp acidity and light, sandy tannins, yet the palate offers a good deal of racy fruit flavors that end clean and refreshing."
"A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Syrah, this has a shy nose that eventually reveals aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit. The straightforward palate offers sweet vanilla and cherry jam alongside round tannins."
Ripe and fruity notes of yellow Mirabelle plums make for an appetizing nose. The palate has a similarly rich impression but lacks a little direction and focus. There is plenty of fruit and lemon brightness. Drink soon.
"Here is a light, tart, all-stainless style of wine, with interesting phenolic flavors of pear skin and green apples. Juicy acids bring a citrus component into it as well. It's lively and fresh: a good all-purpose crisp white wine."
"High-toned cherry aromas meld with saw dust, anise and game on the nose of this pure expression of Nero di Troia. Light- to medium-bodied in style, flavors of savory bramble berries offer plenty of zip to the palate, with soft tannins giving just enough support. An herb-dusted cherry note marks the finish."
"With aromas of white peach and honeysuckle, this wine has flavors of ripe peach, marzipan and orange blossom. It is sweet but not cloying, with a burst of refreshing brightness on the finish."
"This wine is rich, with superripe tannins and a barnyard character. It has structure but it mainly focuses on fruit and acidity. Made by the team at Cos d'Estournel, the wine has a rich structure and will be ready to drink soon, from 2019."
This wine offers a bouquet of grapefruit and lime zest followed by flavors of chirimoya and guava. Grapefruit flavors return to the palate just in time for a zippy finish.
"This estate features biodynamically grown fruit and artisanal winemaking practices. This wine is tart and focused in snappy lemon, orange and pineapple flavors."
This wine has a nice oomph of blackberry flavor and full enough body to carry it well. It feels rich and velvety on the palate and a generous layer of fine tannins doesn't get heavy.
"Lemon balm, herbs and citrus blossom aromas show a nice, clean intensity on the nose. Bright on the palate, with a bit of weight and roundness, citrus pith and fleshy yellow apple flavors meld with more balmy, herbal notes."
"Mild white-fruit aromas suggest peach juice. This Godello is both plump and citrusy in feel. Generic citrus flavors are closest to orange. This is a touch bitter and slightly oxidized on the finish, so drink now."
"Lemon and hay aromas carry delicate pollen and floral tones on the nose. Medium in weight and acidity, the palate is yellow-fruit driven, with a grapefruit zest vein of acidity."
"This is a big bold wine that lays on the oak flavor without restraint. A strong aroma of cedar and baking spices is followed by very concentrated dark-fruit flavors and spicy charred oak flavors. It is quite tannic and almost thick in texture, giving plenty of grip on the palate."
"Compared to the 2015 vintage which retained its liveliness, this new vintage seems woody and oxidized. It's a natural wine, and those can sometimes thrill tasters willing to stretch out a bit. Here, it's soft and slightly flat, with flavors of mashed fruits. Drink up."
"Light floral and peach aromas lead to a lively palate full of fresh fruit, lychees, and honey while a subtle fizz helps balance out considerable sweetness. It's a charming, light wine that's easy to swallow."
"Very much the local white grape, Arinto benefits from the relatively cool climate of the region to give a delicious, crisp wine. It is aromatic, full of citrus flavors with a zesty, mineral edge. Drink this wine now."
"There's plenty to enjoy about this lighter-than-average Primitivo. It's ripe and spicy, with a strong showing of bramble berries and anise. A soft, pliable feel make it immediately appealing."
"While closed on the nose, the palate of this easy-drinking Riesling is plump in tones of juicy yellow peach and citrus. It's a lively, mouthwatering sip offering just a touch of bitter herb on the finish. Drink now through 2019."
"Vineyards close to Portugal's highest mountain range give this wine a crisp, cool character. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Alfrocheiro, it is fruity with red currants and plenty of acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
"Smoky, earthy aromas are cloaked by red- and black-fruit intensity on the nose. The palate brings ripe berry flavors boosted by leather, cedar and allspice, while the tannins are grippy and spicy but cut through by a vein of acidity. Tangy currant and allspice tones carry through the finish."
"Aromas of orange-blossom honey, peach and lemon zest waft from the glass. The palate shows clementine, ripe white peach and lemon juice, with a crushed rock minerality. The sweetness is balanced by a bright backbone of acidity leading to a clean lemony finish."
"The elegant Minho stone manor house is the heart of this fine vineyard. The wine, still with a light prickle on the tongue, is a classic from the Vinho Verde region, crisp, incisive and packed with fruit. Drink this tangy wine now."
"Ripe tangerines are accented by notes of caramel, crushed earth and fennel in this earthy, slightly savory kabinett. Bristling lemon acidity and honey tones brighten the midpalate, leading a finish edged by spice and a hint of tannins."
"This wine offers aromas and flavors of baked red currant, red plum, eucalyptus, black pepper and rare meat. Its zippy acidity is a great match for the full body and depth of flavors."
"This winemaker's selection is from a warm ripe vintage, yet it remains rather light. The fruit touches on pomegranate and raspberry, and a whiff of ground coffee suggests some time in a percentage of new or once-used oak. It's light on the palate and stiffly herbal through the finish."
"The winery makes a number of block and clone cuves, along with regular and reserve Pinots. It would perhaps differentiate them as well as showcase them more distinctively to focus on blending fewer, more complete wines. This reserve has the same high acid, herbal, earth and stem character as the regular bottling."
"Just a touch of fresh apple appears on the almost mute nose. The palate follows with easy, clean apple and ripe pear notes on a slender, light body. The finish is dry and refreshing. Drink soon."
"This very sweet, 210g/l dessert wine was produced cryogenically. It's peachy and syrupy, with candied apricots and a touch of maple syrup. There's just enough acidity to cut some of the treacle, but the sweetness has a sugary granularity rather than a smooth, integrated mix of flavors."
"Baked licorice leads the nose on this blend of 74% Merlot and 26% Cabernet Franc, along with thyme and stewed elderberries. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied, carrying flavors of exotic marjoram and red currant."
"The nose is closed and does not want to give too much away. The palate, however, has lovely lemon and fresh pear fruit on a rather light, dry body. This is fresh, easy and fairly neutral, but clean and fresh. Drink soon."
"Nothing but the slightest hint of lemon appears on the closed nose. The palate is clean and fresh, just hinting at green pear. Drink soon."
"You'll find aromas of toast, nut and a whiff of adhesive bandage on this. The aromas carry over the rather lean, somewhat muddled palate along with dried cherry, a hint of lead pencil, powdered sage and a confectionary note alongside steely bubbles."
"Toasted nut, medicinal herb and bread crust aromas follow through to the lean palate along with yellow-apple skin, sage and bitter almond. Fresh acidity and a vigorous perlage provide the backdrop."
Raisin and prune aromas announce a chunky palate that's solid but not agile or elegant. Flavors of prune and cassis come with a sense of grape skins. It finishes well.
"Aromas of red currant are bright and fresh, with little apparent new-oak influence. Raspberry and currant flavors bring more of the same. It's a straightforward, easy drinker."
"This is a good, solidly built table wine with a robust texture and bold fruit and dark-spice flavors. It barrels straight ahead in style and will easily wash down some Korean barbecue or steak fajitas."
"Lettuce and white-fruit aromas lead to a plump palate with modest acidity. Yeasty melon and powdery apple flavors dry out on the finish, leaving a note of tropical papaya."
"Slightly stalky aromas are not the cleanest. In the mouth, this has lime-like acidity and yeasty white-fruit flavors that include mild green notes. A chalky finish closes out this basic Cava."
"Hints of fresh, green pear and a touch of lemon appear on the nose. The palate offers more of the same on a dry, light body which lacks a little focus. Drink soon."
"Rich, probably too rich, this is a smooth, concentrated wine. Its tannins are already embedded in the cushion of superripe fruit offering flavors of black plums and dark chocolate. The wine will age quickly; drink from 2019."
"Subdued notes of lemon and herb on the nose extend to the palate of this off-dry, slightly earthen Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors are moderately concentrated but pleasantly clingy on the finish. Drink now."
"Ripe, sweet yellow peach and tangerine flavors are shaded by darker tones of smoke and sea water in this slightly rustic, savory kabinett. It's well balanced by acidity and the finish is refreshing and crisp."
"This wine is ripe, soft, rich and smooth. Its tannins are totally integrated into the generous damson fruit. Lightly textured and with balanced acidity, the wine is ready to drink."
"Underbrush, dried herb and toasted aromas lift out of the glass while the no-frills palate evokes wild cherry, ground clove and a hint of coffee bean. Fleeting tannins give loose support. Drink soon."
"Fleshy and simple, this is packed with flavors of strawberries. It's fresh and forward, with a ripe core of fruit. Don't look for complexity here, just enjoy it for its lush strawberry goodness."
"Intriguing aromas of dark pomegranate, white pepper, crushed gravel and herb meet with a touch of tar on the nose of this appellation blend. The mouthfeel is heavy and the density impresses, but the flavors of rich cranberry and tart orange rind are a bit muddled and sour."
"Aromas of toasted walnut, yellow stone fruit and candied citrus zest follow through to the vigorous palate along with bitter yellow-apple skin and a hint of medicinal herb. Steely bubbles provide a rather aggressive perlage."
"A hint of smoked nuts lends a savory tone to flavors of pressed apple and pear. While delicate in concentration, it's dry and approachable, with refreshing lemon-lime acidity. Drink now."
"Slighty muted tones of strawberry and red apple are glazed with caramel in this slightly off-dry blanc de noir, a Pinot Noir vinfied like a white wine. Light bodied and soft in acidity, it's an easy, approachable wine to drink now."
"A ripe, rich, perfumed nose of butter, citrus, melon and yeast lead into a palate that feels a little disjointed, with a creamy, weighty texture yet biting acidity and very little fruit."
"Made with 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas of red plum and baking spice. The aromas carry over to the simple palate together with a hint of vanilla. Round tannins lend easy support."
"This wine, with its earthy aroma and light oak aging, is made for early drinking. Its red fruits and acidity are generous, rounded with the warmth of the Alentejo in its texture. The wine can be drunk now."
"Thick, oaky and exceptionally high in alcohol, there's no subtlety to this wine. The full-bodied fruit flavors bring apple, melon and papaya into play, but it would be difficult to match this to food."
"This Chardonnay is reminiscent of a fruit salad, with lush aromas and flavors of lemon, banana, pineapple, honeydew and peach yogurt. Mild acidity keeps everything in check and leads to a short finish."
"Spicy aromas of licorice and cedar mingle with vanilla and cassis on the nose. The tannins are somewhat gritty on the palate, with spicy black pepper, cedar and pomegranate flavors. The acidity helps pull this wine together but tannic, oaky flavors overpower with only a suggestion of black fruit on the lingering finish."
"Not quite as concentrated as the previous vintage, the fruit flavors of melon and pear are correctly varietal, yet somewhat dilute. The wine was fermented entirely in tank, and there is just a hint of metal flavoring the finish."
"Subdued aromas of nut, dried apricot and overripe nectarine zest all follow over to the straightforward palate along with a hint of yellow apple. A light touch of almond marks the close."
"This opens with muddled aromas suggesting minestrone soup, prune, celery and coffee that carry over to the full-bodied palate along with mature black cherry, baking spice and crushed black olive. Loose-knit, close-grained tannins try to hold it all together."
"While oak dominant on the nose in aromas of roasted berries, the palate reveals a bit more complexity and balance. Medium-bodied and silken in feel, this shows ripe berry flavors, lifted by shades of violets and crushed granite. There's a slight dip in concentration on the midpalate yet overall this is enjoyable for its soft, approachable feel."
"Lush and rich aromas of candied red cherries and vanilla dust show on the nose of this bottling. Rosewater and fruit punch flavors arise on the sip, riding into a vanilla dust finish."
"Light aromas of melon, pear and herb lead to similarly faint fruit flavors. It's cleanly made but everything seems very dialed back."
"Furry plum and berry aromas are good but fragmented. Racy acidity creates tension and some rawness on the palate, while this wine tastes of tart black plum and black currant. Latent acidity on the finish results in strained freshness."
"There's a very strong scent of licorice on the nose of this blend of 54% Syrah and 46% Merlot, along with dark-red fruit and myrrh. Eucalyptus oil flavors arise on the palate, giving intrigue to the black cherry, peppercorn and roasted meat touches."
"The nose is extremely shy but the tangy straightforward palate shows white cherry, Gala apple and a hint of almond. It's linear and crisp, with bright acidity a vivacious perlage."
"A ripe, fruity blend of local Do grapes, this unoaked wine bursts with blackberry flavors. Acidity and tannins back up the juicy fruitiness of the wine. Drink now."
"Full bodied and voluptuous, this fleshy red blend offers soft, easy black cherry and berry flavors powdered with cinnamon and cocoa. Soft, yielding tannins amplify its plush, easy style. Drink now."
"Floral and honey-like aromas lead to very sweet flavors of apricot and peach in this medium-bodied wine. A good choice for friends that only drink sweet, or with your dessert."
"This wine is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon along with 25% Cabernet Franc and 25% Malbec. Slightly elevated volatiles are followed by aromas of cherry, cinnamon, green herb, licorice and baking spice. Flavors are light and elegant in style."
"Dusty aromas of white fruits are equaled by barrel-based vanilla scents. A round, easy palate gives off a powdery sense, while this barrel-fermented Viura-Tempranillo blend tastes yeasty and of green banana. Latent acidity on the finish creates mild sourness."
"Aromas of watermelon Jolly Rancher, peach and flower are followed by broad honeysuckle and stone-fruit flavors. It doesn't all come together."
"This is a serviceable red, built to be enjoyed now, approachable in its mix of doughy leather, black cherry and structured tannin."
"Strawberry jam and green herb aromas are joined by a delicate floral flavor on the medium-bodied palate. Bright acidity and grainy tannins lead to a crisp, dry finish."
"Ripe pear notes signal a fresh, fruity wine. The palate is slightly dilute but offers crisp lemon to brighten a fairly neutral but dry palate. Drink soon."
"Underbrush, toast and scorched earth aromas follow over to the rather lean palate along with dried cherry, a hint of prune and clove. Dusty fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish."
"Red berry jam aromas meld with fresh raspberry and baking spice on the nose. The palate is light in feel, with ripe juicy berry flavors struck against a dry, chalky finish."
"Dusty mineral and saline notes lend savoriness to muted red apple and raspberry in this dry blanc de noirs, a Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine. The palate is broad and soft in acidity, finishing brisk but clean. Drink now."
"A dark and rusty color combined with leafy red-fruit aromas gets this Trepat Cava going. A pulling palate borders on astringent, while leafy, slightly bitter citrus flavors are rustic and match the nose."
Spiced red-berry aromas meet shades of herbs and sarsaparilla on the nose. Sandy tannins and bright acidity provide the backbone for a medium-bodied palate of tart red fruit and savory herbs.
"Raspberry and currant aromas ride over subtle tones of cedar, licorice and vanilla bean. This is a big wine, with intense oak flavors of vanilla, allspice and cedar that overpower the cranberry and raspberry fruit flavors. Plentiful grippy tannins are balanced by a backbone of acidity. The spicy tannic finish dissipates to a softer cedar note."
"Produced from organically grown grapes and bottled without sulfur, this wine is young, crisp and full of black fruits. Its tannins and juicy acidity suggest the wine needs to age and fill out. Wait and drink from 2020."
"This bright wine offers black-currant flavors and firm tannins. It is more fruit than structure, giving a generous wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2020."
"This wine treads a fine line between serious wood aging and ripe fruit. At this young stage, both characteristics are in play, giving a wine that is both full of black fruits and toasty, dry flavors. Give it time and drink from 2023."
The nose carries aromas of ruby grapefruit alongside honeydew melon. Bright lemon-lime acidity enlivens flavors of key lime and gooseberry on the grassy palate. Hints of bitter lime creep on the finish.
"Aromas of clementine and juniper berry set the scene for flavors of apricot, white peach, and almond. Offering nice mouthfeel, this wine has a touch of almond blossom on the short finish."
Aromas of honeysuckle and a whiff of tropical fruit lift from the glass while the soft round palate offers yellow peach and a confectionary note. It's simple but well made.
"The grape is rare in Oregon, and most commonly found in Central Europe, where it produces a spicy tannic somewhat rustic red. Here, it's rather thin, in both color and flavor, with dilute strawberry fruit. It's texturally most interesting, and that holds your attention through an otherwise ordinary finish."
"First produced in 1850, this is widely seen as the original branded red wine in Portugal. The Castelo fruit, then and now, comes from the Setbal Peninsula. It gives a crisp, juicy and light wine with soft tannins. There is some spice, although the main thrust of this wine is delicious red fruit. Drink now."
"Aromas of clover and yeasty vanilla lack concentration. This feels a bit oily, while nonspecific citrus flavors finish with a note of grape skins and brine. It's acidic and medium to light in body."
"Earthy, soupy berry aromas are touched up by forced oak. This wine is tannic, screechy and acidic on the palate, with a swath of creamy oak. Herbal, saucy plum and berry flavors finish raw, pulling and tannic, with an excess of oak flavor."
"Jammy red-fruit aromas linger under a blanket of oak-driven coffee in this wine. The palate mirrors the aromas, yet the creeping acidity and medium-grained tannins offer a nice counterbalance."
"This seems somewhat disjointed and angular, with tart, almost sour berry and cherry fruit. There are acetic scents and chewy tannins. Though labeled reserve, it's a wine that fails to deliver the more subtle pleasures of the grape. Perhaps this would best be served along with a hearty stew."
"A mix of five different Pinot relatives (not clones), this seems a bit overworked. It's flat in the mouth, and the mix of grapes, some white, some red, simply blends into a rather generic tasting white wine. If it resembles anything, it's a Pinot Noir Blanc, and it's already drying out, so drink up."
"A particularly good value, this appealing and inexpensive wine adds light and tasty oak and spice accents to a good base of plummy flavors. It feels light and fresh on the palate and has enough concentration for a bit of a lingering finish."
"Delicate hints of candied red apple and honeydew extend from nose to palate in this easy-going white blend. Off dry and soft in acidity, it's an approachable everyday sip. Drink now."
The Arinto in this attractive wine gives it a floral character. Bright acidity and citrus fruits add a crisp lift and go with the hint of oak aging. This refreshing wine can be drunk now.
"This is hugely tannic, nearly impenetrable wine, hard to break through, a mix of pencil lead, tobacco leaf and dried herb that presents as bittersweet and a touch green."
"Dried black cherries, baked earth, rust and a hint of feral aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers an interesting line of tart red fruit along with dried thyme and a meaty touch."
"Snappy aromas of tangerine lead to a chunky palate with thickness as well as cutting acidity. This tastes of dried melon and bitterness, while on the finish it's chunky, with distant flavors of green melon."
"The nose on this 85% Vermentino and 15% Viognier blend reveals delicate aromas of candied citrus and almond. The palate is straightforward, offering white peach and bitter almond notes."
"Raisiny aromas indicate that this Syrah is a bit overripe and lazy. Its big, bulky palate is weighty but unfocused, with a jammy berry flavor profile backed by a plump finish."
"A blend in equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and cooking spice. The lively palate offers cherry jam, tangerine and mocha alongside supple tannins."
"This wine has a persistent bitter note that's part earthy, part savory and a touch extreme. Rhubarb, rose, black tea and cardamom all figure in, but don't get along all together well."
"Brandied cherry juice and crushed herbs have a slightly saucy feel in this Rosato from the thin-skinned Bombino Nero. There's nice weight to the palate, which boasts flavors of strawberry jam and additional herbs, alongside soft acidity in the background."
"Though considerably higher in finished alcohol than the previous vintage, this still carries an impression of underripe fruit. It's tart, thin and tannic, lightly cloaked in baking spices from barrel aging."
"This wine comes off as a bit green out of the gate, with aromas of mortared fresh herb along with blueberry, woodspice and vanilla. Flavors are soft and light, concentrated in the middle but missing at the edges. The tannins bring a lightly gritty feel."
"A mild nose offers bready aromas. The plump, foamy palate delivers short, briny flavors of generic citrus fruits in front of a clean finish with no complexity. Enjoy this in casual situations, or blended with fruit juice."
"Lightly earthy, this offers pleasant berry fruit, though it comes across as more generic than specific to the variety. There's a light touch of toast also, perhaps from the barrel aging. Drink up over the next couple of years."
"Dull aromatics open the way to thick dense red fruit, oak and a thickness of tannin in this estate-driven red which drinks heavy on the palate. Cedar and pencil shavings accent it well."
"Heady aromas of canned peach, kumquat and pollen convey the awaiting playful sweetness. The confected palate shows flavors of ripe yellow peach, candied mandarin and quince. This wine is plush with just enough acidity to keep it from becoming cloying, while flavors of Satsuma and honeydew melon carry through the medium-short finish."
"Used leather, underbrush scorched earth and toasted aromas slowly appear on this evolved wine. The mature palate shows prune and the heat of evident alcohol. It's seen better days for sure. Drink sooner rather than later before it dries out completely."
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this has aromas suggesting moist forest floor, truffle, cassis and a whiff of graphite. The palate is on the lean side, offering suggestions of blackberry, orange rind, game and star anise alongside dusty, rather fleeting tannins and firm acidity."
"This opens with delicate aromas of black plum and baking spice. The simple palate delivers vanilla, prune and star anise alongside round tannins."
Medicinal berry and plum aromas result in a latex scent. High acidity creates pinching and narrowness on a palate with plum and berry flavors that are more racy and red than dark and ripe. Edgy tannins resurface on a raw finish.
"This ultraripe blend of 85% Negroamaro and 15% Malvasia Nera is jammy in black- and red-fruit aromas, with sweet baking spice aromas peppered throughout. The palate feels thick, with black fruit tones under a sheen of cocoa dust and licorice. A bit of acidity helps clean things up come the finish."
"Rich and fruity, this bargain buy shows strawberry and blackberry jam aromas and flavors, speckled with green herb and floral tones. There's some breadth to the palate from the ripe fruit, yet enough tannic grip and acidity to maintain balance."
"Primarily Cabernet Franc, this blend has pleasing aromas of cranberry, plum, lavender, mint and licorice. There is also a charred oak note that carries through onto the palate and overpowers the other flavors. Zippy acidity adds a welcome freshness that cuts though some of the rough tannins. The finish is long and woody."
"Aromas suggesting underbrush and smoke carry over to the simple palate along with raw cranberry and a hint of clove. It's light bodied, with racy acidity and a lean finish."
"Aromas of stewed prune and toasted notes lead the nose on this brawny red. Searing alcohol dominates the palate and throws it off balance while blackberry extract, licorice and toasted oak notes linger in the background. Grainy tannins give it an astringent finish."
"Snappy aromas of tangerine lead to a chunky palate with thickness as well as cutting acidity. This tastes of dried melon and bitterness, while on the finish it's chunky, with distant flavors of green melon."
"Prune and cassis aromas are timid and earthy. This crianza from a cool, rainy year feels choppy, but has substance. Spicy, peppery red-fruit flavors are dry and finish with acidic freshness."
"Sarsaparilla, cherry and blackberry show medium intensity on the nose. Light in feel, with juicy dark fruit flavors shot through with pomegranate acidity, the palate is supported by medium-grained tannins. A light cherry cola flavor rounds out the finish."
"Soft aromas of lemon oil, dried hay and crushed stone carry the nose. The palate shows a bit more ripeness in yellow apple and grapefruit flavors, with a mild vein of acidity offering some balance."
"Yeasty pear and melon aromas are basic. That could be said for the palate, which is soda-like. Mild citrus and apple flavors dry out on a finish with grassy notes."
"With more Cabernet Sauvignon than Merlot, this wine has delicious black-currant flavors as well as a dry edge to the tannins from 12 months in wood. It leaves a bright, fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2021."
"This wine is ripe, bright with black-currant fruit and crisp acidity. It is simple, easy and fruity. Oak aging gives a smooth character to the soft, warm wine that is ready to drink."
"Bruised apple peel and very ripe, yellow pear signal ripeness and abundant fruit. While the palate is light it is similarly generous with fruit, helped along by a touch of residual sweetness. This is fruity and friendly, with an off-dry finish. Drink soon."
"Candied flavors like caramel and butterscotch make this full-bodied wine seem sweet, while a lush, soft texture coats the palate."
"While quiet on the nose, hints of fresh apple and blossoms are a pleasant introduction to this brisk, uncomplicated white blend. Off dry and light in body, it's an easy quaffing wine, with a fresh grapefruit finish."
"Jammy red berry aromas and flavors mix with grilled herbs and are grounded by a sanguine vein. Medium in weight and structure, the acidity starts off soft but builds on the midpalate, offering a bit a levity on the finish."
"Earthy berry aromas are a bit stalky and flat. This crianza is firm and choppy, but also stewed on the palate. Spicy plum and olive flavors are ordinary if not a touch underripe."
"Oily aromas of orange peel are lively but imprecise. This Verdejo ranks as fruity but simple, with plumpness and citric acidity. Briny citrus flavors give off a sense of grape skins that extend onto the finish."
Reduction clings to the nose but the body is fresh and clean. This is dry and lacks a little fruit and direction but has freshness to redeem itself. The finish is dry and clean. Drink soon.
"Light aromas of white flower, lemon curd and spice are followed by sleek, light fruit flavors. It's a straightforward, varietally correct wine."
"Pungent pineapple aromas, along with a hint of kerosene, indicate that this will not be your standard style of Oregon Pinot Gris. The intense herbaceous character dominates, suggesting some of the stylistic terminology that might accompany a particularly biting Sauvignon Blanc. Some 10% was fermented in concrete egg."
"An entry-level effort, this has thinly-ripened berry flavors, stiff tannins and acids like a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. But it is the aggressive earthy and herbal components that dominate and continue to resonate through the finish."
Powdery nectarine and orange-rind aromas comprise the nose on this tangy ros Cava with a soda-like mouthfeel. Slightly tart apricot and orange flavors show latent bitterness prior to a yeasty-tasting finish that's not that long.
"A hearty 12% Cabernet Sauvignon is added to this wine, which is aged in 100% French oak. Reduced, with sizable oak influence, it shows dried herb components wrapped in bittersweet black pepper and leather."
"Almost tawny in color, this wine offers aromas of red and black plum, dried fig and prune, with secondary notes of cedar and balsamic. These aromas translate onto the palate where the tannins are abundant, yet silky, and the acidity isn't shy."
"This lightly perfumed wine is also crisp and fruity. Good acidity, citrus fruit and a zesty texture give freshness and a bright character. The wine is ready to drink."
"Melon and kiwi aromas are a touch green. This wine feels tangy but also plump, while lemon-lime flavors give way to skins-driven bitterness. A bland finish with residual tang is direct in feel."
"Smoky roast beef aromas mingle with peppercorns and black cherries on the foxy nose. The palate shows ripe cherry and cranberry, alongside cedar, pepper and sweet baking spices. The tannins provide an appealing grip, with balanced acidity and good structure. The finish kicks off on peppery spice then softens into raspberries."
"This Viognier is bursting with passion fruit, honeydew, peach and elderflower aromas that carry right through to the palate. The mouthfeel is a little flimsy but there are great flavors here."
"This is part of the winery's Winemaker Series, a limited production wine that was barrel-aged for 17 months in two-thirds new French oak. It remains stiff and quite astringent, with vanilla being the principal flavor. In fact, there is so much vanilla that it more or less covers most of the fruit."
"Fruit for this wine comes from Block 66 of Double Canyon Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills. The aromas aren't entirely harmonious, with notes of dark, slightly overripe-seeming fruit along with black pepper and licorice, showing some volatility. The black-raspberry flavors are light and compact. It doesn't come together."
"Despite the excellent vintage this is just barely ripe, with green notes among generic red fruits. Tannins are stiff, and a hint of butter runs through the finish. Nothing really jells."
"This blend of 79% Shiraz and 21% Mourvdre is dense and concentrated, with deep notes of all-fruit preserves, raspberry sauce and licorice. The palate offers more decadence in waves of fudgy brownie and candied cherry, while the thick and chewy tannins lend some serious grip and a firm texture. Drink now."
"Mild fruit aromas are crowded by peanut and burnt-wood notes. This Viura-led blend is full and round on the palate, with forceful flavors of nutty stone fruits, sea brine and wood resin. A lean, acidic palate is better in feel than weak flavors."
"This wine is straightforward in its ripe melon and citrus aromas, which carry to the lightly concentrated palate. There's something enjoyable about its simple, fruit-driven nature that makes it an easy wine to sip on."
"Aromas reminiscent of a struck match and a whiff of medicinal herb lead the nose. The palate is on the lean side, offering yellow-apple skin, lemon zest and a taste of bitter walnut alongside continuous lively bubbles."
"This wine comes from a small 12-acre vineyard. Black-currant fruits and firm tannins keep the wine structured while maintaining a crisp character. The wine is simple, fruity and will be ready to drink from 2020."
"Predominately Uva di Troia, with additions of Aglianico and Montepulciano, this blend shows aromas of peanut skins over crushed bramble berries and violets. The palate is light in feel, tart berries are zesty and bolstered by drying, grippy tannins. Racy acidity cuts this short but makes it a food-friendly wine."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this has aromas that bring notes of black licorice and cherry, along with light oxidative notes. It's a shame, as good things are happening on the palate."
Slightly reductive aromas of wet clay and sour olive meet with dark cranberry fruit and camphor on the nose of this bottling. The palate is tart with raspberry and orange rind and gains complexity from the forest moss and wet wood flavors.
"While the nose is earthen and mineral, the palate of this light-bodied blend of Silvaner and Riesling offers pleasant lemon and green melon refreshment. It's a juicy, uncomplicated sip, with subtle sweetness and a brisk finish. Drink now."
"A good blast of black cherry and cedar in the aroma is followed by rich, grapey flavors on a moderately firm texture. It is softened by a hint of sweetness on the finish."
"Red- and black-plum aromas dominate the nose, with layers of coffee, kirsch and geranium in the background. A coffee tone starts off on the palate, moving to cranberry, grape and plum flavors. Zippy acidity matches the full body to create a nice balance."
"It's not apparent what's going on with this wine, which tastes disjointed and aggressively stemmy. Its fruit is thin and generic, plain red berries, with a whiff of compost. But the impact of stems (whole clusters?) is what dominates. Two bottles tasted with equal results."
"Aromas are light and dominated by barrel notes, including vanilla and coconut. The black-fruit flavors are sweet and rich, showing quite a bit of warmth. It doesn't all add up."
"Despite the excellent vintage this is just barely ripe, with green notes among generic red fruits. Tannins are stiff, and a hint of butter runs through the finish. Nothing really jells."
"This blend of 79% Shiraz and 21% Mourvdre is dense and concentrated, with deep notes of all-fruit preserves, raspberry sauce and licorice. The palate offers more decadence in waves of fudgy brownie and candied cherry, while the thick and chewy tannins lend some serious grip and a firm texture. Drink now."
"Mild fruit aromas are crowded by peanut and burnt-wood notes. This Viura-led blend is full and round on the palate, with forceful flavors of nutty stone fruits, sea brine and wood resin. A lean, acidic palate is better in feel than weak flavors."
"At just 10% alcohol and 22 g/l residual sugar, you might expect a fruity wine with a fair amount of sweetness, which indeed is what you get. Simple fruit flavors of apple and melon come with a slightly granular sugary finish."
"Lemon peel aromas take on a slightly savory cheese-rind like tone on the nose. The palate offers richness from oak, displaying toasted nut flavors over lemon and apple. The oak seems a bit disjointed, throwing the fruit tones off balance."
"Saucy plum and cherry syrup aromas turn brighter and cleaner on the medium-bodied palate. A bit of sweet spice kicks in on the midpalate, but ultimately this is primary, soft in feel and straightforward."
"Canned peas taking center stage over grapefruit and white flowers in an interesting mix of aromas. There's decent weight to the palate, with bright acidity to boot, yet the flavors are subdued and focus on the citrus and herbal elements."
"This wine shows mealy apple, margarine and nut aromas on the nose. The flavors are similar yet the mouthfeel is easy-going and pleasing."
"Sweet-tart red cherry and berry flavors are plump and juicy in this fresh, easy drinking Dornfelder. It's not a complicated wine but balanced in sweetness and acidity. Drink now."
"This Merlot shows aromas and flavors of bright cherry, red plum and baking spices. The fruit comes off as tart on the palate but the oak spices are appealing. Not much tannic expression but a nice acidic lift keeps the finish going strong."
"Wild-berry aromas are muted and a shade green on the nose. Cassis, wild raspberry and tart cranberry flavors are at odds with cedar, cinnamon and oak influences. Lacking focus, crushed velvet tannins attempt to pull everything together, riding into a tangy finish."
"Violet, blueberry and cedar aromas ride over a rubbery tone. Mild acidity struggles to keep jammy pomegranate and cranberry flavors in check, while structured tannins and white-pepper flavors tingle on the tongue."
"Subdued aromas of underbrush, moist soil, chopped herb and a whiff of red berry appear in the glass. The simple light-bodied palate shows suggestions of sour cherry and white pepper alongside loose fleeting tannins. Drink now."
"This opens with earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a hint of crushed black olive. The aromas carry over to the extremely simple palate alongside round tannins."
"Viognier above 16% alcohol is really pushing the boundaries of ripeness, and it results in a rather flat-tasting wine with one-dimensional fruit flavors and nothing else. Peaches and melon, with a hint of citrus rind come through, but how do you match this to food?"
"Made in Montana with grapes from Yakima Valley, this wine shows aromas of tangerine, white peach and honeysuckle. The palate is juicy in ripe lime, fresh apricot and blossom tones, with enough acidity for balance. The finish is brief and peachy."
"Spiced fruit cake aromas dominate the nose and carry to the medium-bodied, approachable palate. This is simple and straightforward with everything in balanceperfect for everyday enjoyment."
"An atypical variety for such a southern region, this Pinot Grigio shows some semblance to its brethren in the north, with apple, citrus and blossom tones, yet its missing all of the vibrancy and verve from a lack of acidity. Nevertheless, it's a perfectly clean and simple drink."
"A dark color and damp aromas of raisin lack freshness. Overall, this wine is stewed and oaky, with a heavy palate that's showing salty oak-driven berry and prune flavors. It's missing in balance and finishes with persistent saltiness."
"Reticent on the nose in aromas of struck flint, citrus and pollen, these notes carry to a astringent palate of apple and citrus. Medium in weight, there's just enough mouthwatering acidity to maintain freshness."
"Aromas of soda water, peach and melon lead to broad, dry, slightly viscous fruit flavors. It's an unusual interpretation of this variety."
"Rubbery dark-fruit aromas come with cheesy oak scents. This basic Toro has a sticky, saucy mouthfeel bolstered by tartaric acidity. Short, oaky berry flavors are chocolaty, while the finish offers mostly residual oak notes."
"Medium cherry in color, this wine offers aromas of blackberry, cassis and smoked meat. Flavors of black cherry, flint and game never quite coalesce, dropping off into a soft sage-tinged finish."
"This wine offers candied citrus aromas and flavors, with a chalky fruitiness reminiscent of crushed vitamins on the palate. It has mild acidity but is a little flimsy in feel. The finish is long and sour."
"This opens with earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a hint of crushed black olive. The aromas carry over to the extremely simple palate alongside round tannins."
"Viognier above 16% alcohol is really pushing the boundaries of ripeness, and it results in a rather flat-tasting wine with one-dimensional fruit flavors and nothing else. Peaches and melon, with a hint of citrus rind come through, but how do you match this to food?"
"Made in Montana with grapes from Yakima Valley, this wine shows aromas of tangerine, white peach and honeysuckle. The palate is juicy in ripe lime, fresh apricot and blossom tones, with enough acidity for balance. The finish is brief and peachy."
"Barrel fermented for 10 months, this wine, now three years past its vintage, remains awkward and oaky. Flavors of wood and butter dominate, with light generic fruit well in the background."
"Ultraripe cherry and blackberry aromas are covered in a sheen of dark chocolate on the nose of this Negroamaro, Primitivo and Malvasia Nero blend. The medium-bodied palate turns more jammy in baked strawberry and cherry flavors, with grainy tannins and just enough acidity for balance."
"A largely neutral nose hints at papaya and melon. This Viura is lean in feel, with lemony acidity. Generic nectarine and melon flavors flatten out on a finish that's showing early-onset oxidation. Drink right away for best results."
"Baked berry and sweet spice aromas dominate the nose, while toasted oak tones arise on the palate. Medium in weight and light in concentration, crisp acidity keeps this refreshing, but short."
"A dark purple color and aromas of blackberry, creamy oak and pencil lead to a raw, pulling palate that's thick but also high in tartaric acidity. Grainy oak and mocha flavors make a louder statement than does the fruit."
"Toasty and woody, this wine is currently dominated by the wood aging, leaving little space for the juicy red fruits in the background. It will soften and should be less aggressive from 2019."
"Stalky aromas of earthy plum and burnt leaves are not fully ripe. A choppy, gritty palate holds saucy flavors of salted plum, tomato and herbs. A short finish with herbal notes is appropriate. The blend holds Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah."
"Scents of wet hay and overripe raisined fruit don't mislead: those are also the flavors. Some tarragon and citrus is in view, but overall it's disjointed and seems already well on the way to being over the hill."
"Mild aromas of green apple and lemon have a grassy undercurrent, yet the palate is surprisingly lush in flavors of canned peach and mandarin. The finish is rubbery, with notes of lime pith and orange-blossom honey."
"Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, violet and a whiff of wet leather lead the nose. The palate starts off with fleshy black cherry and a hint of clove then but quickly falls apart thanks to loose, fleeting tannins."
"Made entirely with organically farmed Sangiovese, this has delicate aromas suggesting wild berry and blue flower. The fresh, simple palate offers hints of Marasca cherry and raspberry alongside bright acidity."
"Pale lemon and thyme aromas precede a very buttery flavor in this split-personality wine. It is medium bodied, crisp at first sip but turns butterscotchy on the palate."
"Flowery, yeasty aromas are also soapy and buttery, which makes sense given that this is overly mature and was brought up in oak barrels. Moderate acidity means balance is fleeting, and the wine tastes of stale stone fruits and yeast."
"Despite the landmark vintage, this wine seems thin, under-ripe, and rife with green stem and herb flavors. The tannins are substantial, hard and bitter, effectively blocking out the finish."
"The Noir is an equal blend of co-fermented Gamay Noir, Pinot Noir and Trousseau Noir. An interesting experiment, but it emerges with a bitterness around barely ripe flavors of rhubarb and pink berry."
"Raw, herbal, oaky aromas include notes of Navajo sage stick and oak-driven clove. This wine is 85% Monastrell with Syrah, and it feels grabby, tannic and oaky. Creamy oak flavors are soupy, while this wine is plump, chewy and tastes of forced oak on the finish."
"This wine is half Syrah with the rest equal parts Pinot Noir and Tempranillo. Aromas are locked up on first pour, only revealing high-toned notes of barrel spice. Over time, notes of candied raspberry, black licorice and dried cherry start to emerge. The palate brings plump red- and black-fruit flavors. Cranberry notes linger on the finish."
"This wine, with its light structure and ripe red-berry flavors, is all fruit. It has stalky tannins and plenty of acidity and crispness. It's light, fruity and ready to drink."
"Cidery apple aromas are yeasty and powdery. This is regular in feel, without much body or depth. Basic flavors of lemon-lime and apple juice are sugary, while this showslightly oxidized flavors on the finish."
"A fruity blend of Cerceal, Bical and Encruzado, this easy, fruity wine is tangy, full of citrus and orange zest and refreshing. Acidity and crisp flavors are balanced by ripe yellow fruits and an attractive perfumed edge. Drink now."
"Funky aromas of moist underbrush, tilled soil, new leather and game carry over to the rather muddled palate along with black cherry extract, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of clove. Dusty fleeting tannins leave a drying grainy finish."
"This soft, semisweet Dornfelder is a candied swirl of cherry-cola, vanilla and chocolate flavors. It's a plush, easy wine for early consumption."
"Toast, cured meat and roasted herb aromas come to the forefront. On the vivacious palate, dried sage and toasted walnut underscore yellow apple while lively acidity and vigorous bubbles provide the aggressive setting."
"This dessert-style wine is quite flavorful and sweet, from the aroma of apple cider and toasted nuts to flavors of golden raisins and honey. It has an almost thick texture and syrupy finish."
"This wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc (61%), Smillon (23%), Riesling (12%) and Albario. The aromas are a bit faint, with notes of herb, fig, pear and soda water that don't seem entirely in sync. The palate brings broad, dry flavors that come up short."
"This wine has soft tannins and juicy red fruits. It is ripe, with a gentle texture, bright fruitiness and enough tannins to give the fruit their support. Drink this attractive wine now."
"The aromas are oak dominated, with notes of vanilla extract, coconut, dill, spearmint and freshly hewn wood, with the fruit struggling to get to the surface. There's a soft, pleasing feel to the palate but the wood again gets in the way. The fruit is hard to find."
"Viognier can turn sharp and bitter, as it hints at here. The flavors emphasize green botanicals, lime skin and pith. It's definitely on the less-than-optimal side of ripe for this difficult grape."
"An outlier grape for southern Italy, this Pinot Nero is primary in its ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It's light, bright and juicy nature make it an easy-drinking selection."
"Aromas of cranberry, cherry pie and baking spice are inviting on the nose. The palate brings more cranberry and cherry, joined by ripe, juicy pomegranate. Gentle tannins slowly emerge while the tart acidity lightens the baked quality of the fruit flavors. Tart fruit tones linger on the finish, with clove and a final grip of tannin."
"This wine seems awkwardthere is no other way to put it. Unintegrated, lumbery oak flavors jut out in front of brambly berry fruit. Nothing hangs together and the oak treatment is rough and outsized."
"Soupy raisin and prune aromas are earthy and sleepy. This feels a lot like prune juice, but with tannins. Prune is also the sole flavor on this overripe but still decent gran reserva from a hot vintage."
"A good amount of fruit concentration gives this medium-bodied wine likeable aromas and flavors, while a soft smooth texture and a dab of sweetness make it easy on the palate."
"At this stage, the wood-aging component of this wine dominates the gentle black fruits. An element of high toast and black-chocolate extraction flavors give bitterness. It seems this wine will always have a hard edge."
"Dark, jammy fruit aromas are at the core of this otherwise oak-driven wine. Baking spice flavors of vanilla and cocoa powder are prominent and not entirely integrated with the baked fruit character. Medium weight and soft acidity make this an easy-drinking sipper."
"There's a great deal of oak covering the red berry aromas on the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more integration, melding dark cherry and blackberry flavors with baking spice."
"Ripe red berry and plum aromas are covered in a sheen of vanilla and cocoa in this Negroamaro-dominant wine. Medium in weight, with a soft feel, enjoy this with hard cheeses."
"Plenty of grapey, jammy aromas and flavors fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. It is lightly sweet, very fruity, and smooth and soft in texture."
"Delicate apple, pear and mineral flavors give a fruity but lean personality to this light-bodied wine. It makes good, basic refreshment."
"Intensely savory notes of crushed earth and pollen juxtapose prettier red apple and tangerine. While rustic in style, its light body and subtle tangerine sweetness offers approachable refreshment."
"This 50-50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Malvasia is a bit closed on the nose. The palate offers more in its juicy melon and apple flavors, with a hint of florals in the background. This is light in weight and intensity, yet perfect for the price."
"The winery's white wines are extraordinarily high in alcohol, which inevitably blows out any subtleties and varietal character. This is thick, fruity, almost syrupy, with principal flavors of canned peaches."
"The label suggests that this is done in a sweeter style, though it's principally the superripe fruit that you taste. Round and simple, with flavors of peaches, it doesn't deliver the aromatics or the flavor complexity of most Oregon Rieslings."
"Volatile aromas get things off to a difficult start, with a burning sensation and a touch of vinegar. Thin berry fruit and a hint of vanilla wafer come across in the mouth. Two bottles tasted. Drink up."
"Soft scents of white flowers, pear and peach subtly make themselves known on the nose of this direct wine. It's lightweight and approachable, with ripe-fruit and sweet-orange flavors that flesh out the palate. Drink now."
"Pleasant white-fruit aromas are simple. This has a fresh but highly basic mouthfeel. Melony flavors come with green pyrazine notes, while this is dilute on the finish."
"This golden oak-aged Airn smells almost entirely of wood grain and vanilla. On the palate, it's resiny to an extreme. Flavors of raw wood and coconut are devoid of fruit, while this tastes like liquid oak on the finish."
Tropical fruit and sucking-candy aromas are inoffensive and lively. This varietal Merseguera is texturally pulpy but also zippy due to high acidity and only 12% abv. Lime and lychee flavors finish quickly.
"Heavily charred aromas suggest a steak or hamburger left on the grill for too long. In the mouth, this is compact and boxed in by rock-hard tannins. Like the nose, this young Toro tastes burnt and grilled. Flavors of black coffee and clove dominate an oak-driven finish."
"A light straw color, with a hint of tawny skin, this is a blocky, simple and fruity style, high in alcohol with flavors of peaches. There isn't much to it beyond that one-dimensional fruit, and it finishes short and quick."
"Raisiny, saucy aromas are slightly volatile. A wide, saturated palate comes up short on focus and acidity, while a mix of raisin and green-herb flavors lands on a heavy finish."
"A strong, smoky aroma and equally obvious oak flavors dominate this very full-bodied and fairly smooth-textured wine that was aged in whiskey barrels. It's a one-note song, recommended for people who really like that note."
"Stalky cherry and berry aromas announce a lean, tart palate with a texture influenced by grape skins. Plum and currant flavors are thin, and this is earthy, tangy and low on ripeness on the finish."
"A nose with mild citrus and banana aromas is indicative of the fleshy but basic wine that follows. Dry flavors of peach pit are slightly bitter, and it's dull on the finish. This wine marks Cuatro Rayas's 40th year."
"Nectarine and orange aromas are basic and yeasty. A peachy, pulpy palate with flavors of orange and bitter grape skins loses fruit rapidly on the finish."
"This wine is somewhat dull in texture and elusive in fruit, offering a strong sense of oak and sulfur."
"The nose of this wine is melony and chunky, with a touch of oak. The palate feels solid enough but still a bit mushy, while dry, creamy flavors of tropical fruits are diffuse in front of a finish that's low in verve."
"This wine is already past its prime. The blend of Mller-Thurgau, Viognier and Moscato is interesting, but the fruit is fading into a simple, lightly peachy syrup, with a hint of plastic. Drink now."
"Briny, wayward aromas of grape skins and yeast are funky and unfocused. This Verdejo has a pulpy, soft mouthfeel and flat white-fruit flavors that turn bitter on the finish."
This dense and rich wine is dominated by dark-chocolate flavors of excessive extraction and bitterness. The fruit is hard to find in this wine that will probably remain tough.
"With aromas of petrol and spearmint, this wine has flavors of lemon-lime and eucalyptus that do not feel completely integrated. Citrus and minty flavors fight for dominance on the palate, with cooling herb flavors overpowering the finish."
"A dull gold tint and steamrolling barrel aromas announce an oak-heavy wine that's tight, resiny and high in acid. Woody flavors of salted apricot echo on the finish."
This medium-bodied straightforward wine has good fruit flavors and a few hints of black pepper and tobacco to keep it interesting. The texture is smooth and only a light touch of tannin shows through.
"As most Methven Pinots are estate grown, it's not entirely clear what distinguishes this from the others. What it does show, rather agressively, are aromas of leather. Those same flavors render the wine thin, astringent and bitter, amplifying the drying tannins."
"Rough, rubbery aromas suggest road tar. This Monastrell feels clumsy and hollow. Raw, slightly weedy berry flavors are green and minty on a chewy finish."
"A serious commitment to wood aging has given this wine a dark-chocolate and extracted set of flavors. This masks the wine, which seems almost austere. It will likely remain tough."
"This Sauvignon Blanc has little to no varietal character. The nose is quiet, with just a hint of peach. A round palate shows almost no acidity, while this tastes peachy and yeasty prior to a pulpy finish."
"This wine has respectable but generic fruit flavors, a soft texture and a touch of sugar to round off its edges. It is light to medium bodied and tastes low in acidity."
"This wine is severe in acidity, with a somewhat jarring lack of fruit. Butterscotch and melted butter develop in the glass for a lingering richness."
"Pushy oak and heavy clove aromas seem excessive for this level of Garnacha. A rough, grating palate leads to oak-heavy flavors of clove and blackberry, while a persistent flavor of oak-driven clove controls the finish."
"Prickly citrus aromas include notes of white flowers. Yeasty grapefruit and lime flavors are bland and short, while this ends flat, yeasty and lightly oxidized."
"This Tinta de Toro smells like a cherry Lifesaver. In the mouth, there's not much body or substance. Candied blackberry and cassis flavors are medicinal and jammy on the finish."
"Jammy, baked aromas are raisiny and slightly volatile. This blend of 85% Monastrell and Syrah is heavy and soupy, with dull edges. Herbal prune and raisin flavors are raw and green on the finish."
"This pale-colored wine, a blend of Tinta Francisca and Tinta Roriz, was aged in wood for eight months. That was probably too long, for the fruit has been sucked into the wood, leaving a trail of acidity behind."
"Made entirely from Merlot, this sweet pink wine might pass for a simple white Zinfandel. The sugary sweetness comes with light flavors of cherry Kool-Aid."
"Stalky aromas of citrus peel are stale and mostly fruitless. A full, flat palate indicates a wine that has lost its youthful freshness, offering bitter apricot flavors and a finish that's low on acidity."
"The nose of this Marquette is all spice and jammy dark berries, with whiffs of Luxardo cherries. The rounded palate shows warm, baked cranberry, blackberry, blueberry sauce and cedar. Soft tannins lend structure and quiet acidity teeters on the edge of flabby, finishing on cassis and a woody tang."
"Rubbery, medicinal berry aromas smell like Pepto-Bismol. A chunky palate is big and blocky, with no elegance or charm. Candied, grapy flavors finish hard and scratchy."
"A light color and yeasty aromas of sourdough and dusty white fruits are the greeting on this modest white made from Chardonnay, Viura and Moscatel. Flavors of lime are yeasty and finish bitter."
"Stalky aromas are more rough and fruitless than smooth and clean. This brut reserva foams up on the palate and feels clumsy. Briny flavors suggest white pepper but not much fruit, and it's grassy-tasting on the finish."
"Tropical fruit aromas are soft and syrupy. This is chunky and low in acidity, with oily stone-fruit flavors. The finish feels a bit warm and cloying."
"Strange, yeasty aromas suggest boiled ham and buttercup. This feels full and fleshy, with low acidity. It tastes like it smells: yeasty and much like ham, with little fruit."
"Chunky oak rests heavily atop aromas of stale white fruits and nuts. This is obtuse in feel, with stalky, oaky flavors that are largely devoid of fresh fruit."
"This Demeter certified blend of Uva di Troia and Montepulciano carries odd aromas of peanut skins, asparagus and saucy, sour red fruit. The palate offers a bit more enjoyment with its more fruit-forward nature, bracing acidity and abrasive tannins carrying to the finish."
"This blend of Tempranillo, Petite Sirah, Mourvdre and Syrah is thin and leathery. It's already dried out and not heading in a better direction. Two bottles sampled with the same results. Drink up."
"This wine is slightly bittersweet and off-putting, with a dullness to the texture."
"Melony aromas are neutral at best. A pulpy, citric palate holds briny orange flavors that don't show a lot of depth or quality. It falls apart on the finish."
"Blatant aromas of milk chocolate and candied-berry fruits amount to a soupy, heavy, jammy nose. This Monastrell feels choppy and broken. Saucy berry flavors are loaded with oak and clove notes, while this wine tastes like chocolate and feels hot on the finish."
"This offers light aromas of yeasty white flowers and lemon-lime. The palate is weak, while generic white-fruit flavors fall off quickly and taste oxidized on a bready finish."
"Not even close to ripe, with not varietal character, this tart, herbal and stemmy wine just doesn't click."
"Scents of pumpkin, pyrazines and general murkiness lead to a dilute palate. Fruitless flavors of onion and lime finish bitter and with notes of green peppercorn."
"Weathered wood and sawdust aromas are drab. That palate is rounded by flavors of vanilla, oak planks and cherry. Lacking acidity, this finishes flat and oaky."
"Many years in bottle haven't done much for this briary wine with weedy aromas of field greens and spice. A choppy palate with uncontrolled acidity is less than comfortable, while the finish offers nothing but rawness and tannins."
"Aromas of confected orange and molasses are joined by a rubbery note. The palate is sugary, with flavors of candied orange, lychee and dried pineapple, finishing with peach syrup and latex."
"This wine is extreme in bay leaf and green, herbal flavors, with a touch of oxidation."
"This funky, skunky Cava smells stale and slightly rotten. A weedy flavor profile offers no help, while this tastes pickled on the finish."
"Aromas suggest pine oil, pineapple and mango syrup. This wine is shapeless, tasting oddly of rose water and flavored tea. The finish is deficient."
"Intense aromas of potpourri mask cedar and red currant on the nose. Tart cranberry and cedar create a sour palate, while gritty tannins feel disjointed. The finish brings underripe flavors of raspberry and cedar."
"Funky grapefruit and passion fruit aromas are uncommon and not appealing. This white Grenache is wide but spread thin, with no focal point to the palate. Bitter, weedy citrus flavors don't improve on a finish with a dominant green character."
"This isn't just a great wine for what was a notoriously cool, wet vintage, it's quite simply a magnificent wine. Perfumed and loaded with finesse, it opens with scents of woodland berry, iris and baking spice while the vibrant, balanced palate doles out Marasca cherry, dark culinary spice, crushed herb and menthol. Refined tannins and fresh acidity provide the taut framework while a licorice note wraps around the finish. Gorgeous. Drink 20222034."
"A hallmark expression of Nebbiolo, Produttori del Barbaresco's 2013 Rabaj Riserva offers aromas of wild red berry, menthol, Alpine herb, saddle leather and dark culinary spice. The concentrated palate boasts enviable finesse and is practically weightless in the mouth, showing crushed black cherry, juicy raspberry, orange zest, clove and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. Bright acidity provides impeccable balance. Drink 20212033."
"Enticing scents of wild berry, rose, baking spice and balsamic aromas come together in the glass. Juicy and full-bodied, the flavorsome palate shows succulent Morello cherry, cranberry, licorice and ground white pepper alongside a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, polished tannins. It's already exceptional but will benefit with more aging. Drink 20202038."
"Intense scents of cherry, star anise and iris float out of the glass. It's firmly structured and loaded with finesse, offering crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, cinnamon and star anise framed fine-grained tannins. Bright acidity lends balance and energy."
"Forest berry, chopped mint, clove and new leather aromas take center stage on this elegant, full-bodied red. The savory, smooth palate doles out succulent red cherry, raspberry compote and licorice while vibrant acidity and tightly knit, refined tannins provide balance and support. It has great energy and is loaded with flavor but will be even better with a few more years aging. Drink 20202038."
"Vintner Austin Hope, whose family is intertwined in the rise of Paso Robles, spent years working to release a wine of this caliber. Dark and thick in the glass, aromas of black currant and blueberry meet with roasted coffee, chocolate syrup and baked plum on the wondrous nose. The palate is soft and extremely expressive, with blueberry, black pepper, firm midpalate tannins and a finish that's redolent of cappuccino candies."
"Red berry, blue flower, crushed herb and exotic spice aromas unfold in the glass. Elegant, structured and delicious, the full-bodied palate delivers red cherry and licorice, chopped mint alongside bright acidity and firm, refined tannins. It's impeccably balanced and will age gloriously. Drink 2021 -2043."
"Still young but already boasting extraordinary pedigree, this fantastic wine opens with hallmark scents of wild berry, new leather, chopped herb, tilled soil and a whiff of violet. The polished, full-bodied palate delivers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and licorice while youthfully assertive, noble tannins and bright acidity provide age-worthy structure. A pipe tobacco note lingers on the finish. Drink 20232038."
"A deep, velvety purple color in the glass, this bottling by proprietor Roger Bower and winemaker Adam Henkel shows dark-chocolate-covered black cherries, fresh blackberry, white pepper, violet oil, port reduction sauce and spice sake on the lavish nose. Firm tannins frame the palate, which carries black currant and roasted lean beef flavors through soy and pepper sauce into a finish of caramel and espresso grinds."
"A sultry shade of dark purple, this luxury bottling by the Daou brothers shows freshly smashed black currant, gravelly minerality, black pepper, espresso and shaved chocolate on the nose. The palate is black to the core, from blueberry to dark chocolate to lava rocks, with strong yet polished tannins and wel-balanced acidity. Decant now or drink 20202035."
"Wonderfully aromatic notions of blood orange zest and ripe Meyer lemon swirl on nose and palate of this wine. Its slender yet concentrated body imbues that citrus tautness with hints of richer fruitthink juicy Mirabelle plum and ripe orange. A lemon note keeps the balance firmly in the tart camp, making for a zesty, intense and clean midpalate and finish. That blood orange aroma lingers magically. Drink 20202035."
"A faint, flinty touch of reduction still informs this wine's lifted citrus scents. On the palate, a taut, textured structure sends zesty lemon flavors darting across the tongue. This still needs to open up, but all the ingredients for an explosive citrus party are here. It has concentration, freshness, fruit and potential. This may become smoother but will remain beautifully slender. Drink 20202035."
"Fragrant and elegant, this opens with a textbook Nebbiolo bouquet showing scents of tilled soil, rose, wild red berry, Alpine herb and a whiff of new leather. The taut, vibrant palate evokes sour cherry, juicy strawberry, licorice and clove framed in refined tannins and bright acidity. It's balanced and gorgeous but still young, so give it several more years to evolve into the beauty it's destined to become. Drink 20202033."
"This wine takes a light-handed approach, allowing its soul to speak quietly in a blur of perfumed rose petal, lavender and wildflower. The expansive, velvety palate offers highlights of pomegranate, strawberry and freshly squeezed citrus, with pronounced earthy sensations of crushed rock, salt and turned earth."
"This wine offers incredibly inviting aromas and a fresh, vibrant fruit-driven framework which suggests long-term potential. Youthfully gritty tannins hide beneath a forceful foundation of black raspberry, rose petal and warm baking spice, with a hint of dried herb creeping in. Enjoy 20202025."
"Extremely dense in the glass, this epic bottling offers lavish and penetrating aromas of black currant and elderberry jam on the nose alongside seared beef, chocolate cake and a pinch of violet. Expertly balanced, polished tannins make for a soft mouthfeel yet firm structure, carrying flavors of black fruit, chocolate and grilled figs that lead to an espresso note on the finish."
"New leather, camphor, forest berry, dried rose and culinary spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this exceptional red. The firmly structured, poised palate doles out juicy cranberry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise framed in tightly-knit, refined tannins while bright acidity provides energy and balance. Drink 20202033."
"This wine's shy, elusive nose promises hints of ripe citrus and herbal savor. The palate obliges with streamlined, zesty citrus notes and the salty tang of thyme and sage, surrounded by bright lemon freshness. A compact, incisive package of refreshing delight, it dances on tiptoe but knows its every step."
"Deliciously crafted and full-bodied ripe, this shows dense layers of blackberry and blueberry crumble succulence and richness, well-etched flavors that are wrapped in soft integrated oak. Juicy and earthy, it offers length and breadth, the tannins roundly structured. Memorable seasonings include chocolate and clove. Enjoy best 20242034."
"Four years after bottling, this vibrant, peppery red is still taut, begging for time to allow its fruit and earthen complexities to meld. Pristine black-cherry and plum flavors penetrate deeply on the palate, shaded by whispers of smoke, violet, tar and leather. It's powerful, complex wine that's yet to see its peak. Hold till 2020 at least, but it's likely to improve for another decade still."
"Perfumed and meaty, this coastal wine offers strong elements of cured bacon and intense hints of smoke. The nose is additionally gorgeous in rose and dried herbes de Provence. Crisp, savory fruit gives it freshness and complexity, a succulent tartness that lingers a long time on the palate."
"One of the better Chardonnays tasted in recent years from the Central Coast, this bottling by proprietor Blair Pence is both brisk and warm on the nose, with lemon balm, crushed limestone and yuzu cutting through white peach and butter. The tactile chalkiness on the sip is remarkable, carrying flavors of lime pith, Asian pear, sea salt, shaved lemongrass and lime leaf."
"Dark-skinned berry, menthol, new leather, blue flower and baking spice aromas take center stage. On the radiant, full-bodied palate, vibrant acidity lifts red cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, clove and tobacco while youthfully taut, fine-grained tannins provide firm support. Hold on to this for even more complexity once it unwinds and develops. Drink 20232038."
"Combining hyper-concentrated fruit flavors with enticing, sophisticated oak nuances, this wine is a gentle giant. The first thing to notice is the lightly spicy, toasted-baguette aroma, and then the palate floods with saturated, ripe and delicious blackberry and black-cherry flavors, while notes of dark chocolate and black pepper kick in on the finish. This wine ranks with the best yet from Lake County. Best after 2020."
"This wine's wet earth, sun-ripened mirabelle plum and vivid citrus aromas spell out the pleasures to come. The palate is still tentative and youthful but sure to blossom into a citrus flavor explosion. Leave this concentrated, promising wine to calm down. A slender, precise and highly aromatic pleasure awaits. Drink 20202035."
"This wine's pure, ripe Conference pear notes appear on the nose and are given full rein on the palate. They add color and charm to concentrated, savory notions of celery salt and miso. Bright citrus accents make it taut and fresh, depsite that immense concentration. It echoes long on the finish, promising to unfold beautifully with more age. Drink 20202030."
"Always one of the benchmarks for Sangiovese, the 2013 doesn't disappoint. It boasts alluring scents of blue flower, perfumed berry, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak that flow over to the vibrant, elegant palate along with wild cherry, raspberry compote and licorice. Bright acidity and taut, fine-grained tannins provide an age-worthy framework. Give it time to develop to its maximum potential. Drink 20212033."
"Green pear and lemon zest characterize the nose of this concentrated, salty wine. Zesty citrus notes give both texture and direction on the taut palate, which shimmers with savory, yeasty, miso-like saltiness. A very delicious, impactful little package that is sure to unfold beautifully. Drink 20202030."
"A touch of tar, a hint of bitter almond and brooding black cherry fruit mark the nose and spread freely across the palate with dark but delicious intent. This is dense and firm, with drying tannins but no heaviness. There is freshness and intensity to the dark, brooding fruit that will show its true colors with some more agebut all the aromatic promise is already here. Drink 20202035."
"Earth and moss scents join the tart apple notes on the nose of this wine. On the palate, a leesy touch of yeast provides a textural backdrop to zesty lemon, tangerine, grapefruit and orange flavors. Its wonderful concentration creates a memorable impression that captivates and refreshes. This is so pure, so fresh and so lasting. Drink 20202030."
"This multi-vineyard wine is sourced from hillside sites on the eastern edges of the appellation, including Foss and Calegari vineyards. Perfumed in clove and other baking spice tones, it has beautiful aromatics and ripe, firm tannins. The palate is marked by flavors of plum, rhubarb and cherry clafouti."

"A tropical touch of passion fruit plays on the pear-inflected nose of this wine. The concentrated palate, however, is all about lemon freshness and yeasty texture. Soy and miso notions add a salty element while lemon zest and pith notes provide a precise texture. That lemon peel quality dominates with its purity on the long finish. Lovely and compact but very concentrated."
"Layers of mocha, sweet spice and leather integrate seamlessly into luscious black cherry and fig on the palate of this bold, deeply concentrated wine. It's sumptuous, with a kaleidoscope of smoky mineral complexities and a backbone that's peppery and fresh. The long finish is framed by sweet, silken tannins."
"Juicy, ripe pear notions and bright Mandarin accents swirl enticingly on the nose of this wine. They dominate the streamlined, brisk palate for now, but underneath, the savory, herbal and intriguing saltiness of Grner Veltliner shimmers. Along with sage, thyme and miso flavors, they make their full, satisfying appearance on the dry finish. This has both charm and depth. Drink 20202030."
"This wine's complex nose of tangy, herbal Seville orange and salty stoniness leads to a tingling, taut and lip-smacking palate. That tautness is shot through with lively lemon freshness that leaves the palate wanting more. But it still needs to fill out. A little patience will be rewarded with even more fruit. Drink 20202035."
"This is a grainy, herbal red wine, boldly tannic and softly smooth in texture. It takes on mountain airs of sage, clove and tobacco, with a brushy graininess that adds complexity and intrigue. Blackberry, black cherry and currant give a tart fruitiness to the flavor."
"This is a robust white, exhibiting an exotic nose of spicy nutmeg and lemongrass. Fully oaked, it presents ripeness and concentration, a sign of its youthful vigor and the density of the vintage. Lemony acidity provides freshness against the bolder landscape of ripe apple and melon."
"Velvety in concentrated black-cherry and strawberry flavors, this age-worthy wonder also displays floral intensity and persistent, supportive tannins. Bright acidity is layered throughout, adding a sense of energy to the robust nature of its brambly undercurrent of dry-farmed fruit. Enjoy 20202025."
"From a cool site above Occidental, this shows smoky peppercorn, high-toned strawberry and raspberry notesthe fruit expansive and succulent throughout. Focused acidity provides a persistent energy and freshness, with a measured sense of oak."
"This leads with a ripe, tropical whiff of pineapple that's subsumed into a more savory notion of celery-salt and miso. The concentrated palate similarly juxtaposes salty miso with bright lemon notes. In the end, the saltiness triumphs and leaves you wanting more. A compact but very concentrated wine that's full of flavor and has a lip-smacking finish."
"A lovely touch of freshly grated lemon rind appears on the nose of this wine, with the slighest hint of green Seville orange. The palate comes in with pristine green apple freshness, highlighted by lively, zesty lemon notes. It's zingy and taut with citrus freshness, attaining a riper Mandarin notion as it lingers. How enlivening and how lip-smacking. Drink 20182035."
"What a beautiful wine from the famed site still farmed by the Rochioli family. This is fresh, fruity and layered in citrus and Gravenstein apple, with interweaving acidity through flavors of lemon and lime. It has a stony quality that speaks to underlying minerality and a jolt of briny, salty air."
"Softened by 6% Merlot, this is a classically elegant wine, juicy in cranberry, cassis and teases of coffee bean, the tannins broadly etched and brawny in their youth. Integrated oak provides a spiciness of toffee and black licorice, as the aromas develop floral notions of violet as the wine opens in the glass. Enjoy best 20242034."
"Subdued at first, this wine awakens with a little air, as notions of citrus foliage, lemon zest and Mandarin emerge. The palate presents these flavors with purity and verve, adding earthy depth against which the lemon freshness shines. It's taut, concentrated and lovely now but has the stuffing to go the distance. Drink 20182030."
"This wine's pure notes of ripe Amalfi lemon awake the senses. They unfurl on the palate, revealing their full, zesty, linear force, accented by tart red apple and riper orange zest notes. Freshness pervades and highlights the concentration of the streamlined palate, leaving you with a clean, lasting and absolutely addictive finish. Drink 20202030 at least."
Highly aromatic notions of cinnamon-dusted blueberry and plum rise from the glass. The richness of that scent is countered on the palate by ample freshness which gives clean delineation to the fruit flavors and precision to the body. Right now this is taut but flavors run deep. There seems to be a floral core of peony and berry that still needs to unfoldelegance and depth are to come. Drink 20222035.
"Flavor complexity and a lot of finesse in the texture give just about everything a Pinot Noir can give. This wine, from a tiny, high-elevation vineyard, has enticing aromas of mint, clove, bay leaf and red cherry followed by vibrant flavors of red cherry and black tea (that are satisfying but don't overpower the firm texture), fine tannins and welcome acidity. Best after 2020."
"Freshly cut green Conference pear notes hover above more elusive crushed wild thyme aromas in this wine. There is a touch of wet pebble, too. The palate is concentrated but streamlined. An earthy hue of textured miso adds a little richness to the otherwise zesty, lemony, fresh and enduring flavors. Drink 20202030."
"Evocative, tender hints of lemon balm and verbena play on the nose of this wine, alongside ripe lemon and orange peel. The palate has a steely concentration of pure lemon freshness. It's linear, fluid, concentrated and dry. The finish is incisive and lip-smackingly fresh. Drink now2030."
"Stony, flinty reduction still clouds the nose of this wine. Underneath, the promise of citrus is evident. On the palate, that citrus freshness is clothed in juicy swirls of ripe apricot and yellow apple. A sonorous take on Riesling that's intriguing and charming at once. Wait for this to come together. Drink 20202030."
"This wine is currently a big, bold beast, with serious concentration and tremendous depth that suggests this wine's considerable future. Deep aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, plum and raspberry all abound on the nose and mouth, with a equally intense overlay of whole baking spice, campfire, black tea and pepper. The mouthfeel is bold yet balanced, with a texture like crushed velvet and a long, evolving finish that transitions masterfully from dark fruit flesh to charred cherry and baked plum, and then final notes of espresso bean, black forest cake and tilled earth. Expect even more complexity and layers of flavor to develop with age. Built for long-term cellaring, drink 20232033."
"Pure, tender and evocative notes of fresh orange and Mandarin zest characterize the nose of this wine. That zesty freshness veers from Mandarin to Meyer lemon on the taut, fresh almost fizzing palate. Still young, it shows utter promise, with precise flavors and great concentration. Irresistible for its citrus notions now but certain to develop. Drink 20182030."
"A 100% varietal wine, this is brawny in tannin and big in oak, yet completely beguiling in an underlying delicacy of refined power. Chalky texture that traffics in tobacco and leather overlays elusive fruit and persistent earthiness, a mix of blueberry and blackberry bramble and mountain sage."
"This wine must have spent very little time in bottle; it still smells of the leesy, fermentative richness of the cellar. But never fear: this newborn is loaded with lemon concentration and uncompromising briskness. Electric freshness is its central purpose, and it will provide sophisticated refreshment for years to come. Drink 20202030 at least."
"Beautifully pure and life-like apple notes stream from the glass, depicting at once tart crunch and ripe juiciness. That lovely fruit carries all the way across the palate, supported by a streak of zesty lemon and a pithy, tingling texture that tapers into an arrow of freshness. Its trajectory is long, and while lovely now, it will get even better. Drink 20202030."
"Incredibly pure notes of ripe Mandarin peel and juicy tangerine encapsulate the nose of this wine. A full blaze of ripe citrus freshness is then unleashed on concentrated but taut palate. Ripe tangerine, Mandarin and Meyer lemon flavors are expressed with aromatic and heady intensity, performing a high-wire act with bright, stony acidity that keeps it from feeling fleshy or fat. Wow. Lovely now, sure to evolve. Drink 20182035."
"Deep and dark on the nose, this savory bottling, which is enhanced by bits of Viognier and Grenache, shows chocolate, seared beef, black currant, black pepper, rosemary and lamb aromas. It's soft and thick on the palate, where baked black-cherry flavors are spiced by star anise, coffee and cola, with energetic acidity popping on the finish."
"A smoky touch of reduction still hovers on the nose of this wine. Underneath, apple freshness with an earthy, leesy touch and lots of lemon notes spreads across the linear palate. This needs time to unfurl but will do so beautifully. The finish is dry and long and has a wonderfully pure, almost transcendent lemon note. Drink 20202030."
"Pristine, aromatic Mandarin notes color the underlying notions of green and yellow pear in this wine. The palate has that same aromatic Mandarin ripeness, along with textured, concentrated yeast flavors that shimmer with soy saltiness on the palate. The body is taut and streamlined; it promises to be very long-lived. Citrus aromas tingle long into the finish.Drink 20192030."
"Beautifully pure green pear notes are joined by ripe yellow plum aromatic touches on the nose of this wine. These fruit notions persist, despite the palate being all about texture and salty, lemony concentration. Still tightly curled, it needs time to unfold and is totally worth waiting for. Drink 20202030."
"A note of flinty reduction still clings to the pear and yeast notes on the nose of this wine. Apart from citrus zest, the palate almost dispenses with fruit, delivering instead a celery-salted, yeasty, tingling texture. It crackles on the tongue with its freshness and savor and leaves an immensely fresh, long aftertaste. Drink 20202030."
"A touch of citrus foliage and the merest hint of passion fruit color this wine's lemon aromas before taking over the entire palate. Its svelte, linear and concentrated body fizzes with lemon sherbet-like flavor. Let it calm down and reveal all its lemon verve. Drink 20202035."
"An urgent, almost piercing note of green Seville orange zest and conifer leads the nose of this wine. It intensifies on the palate, where it's edged with stony saltiness and a touch of dark, bitter fir honey. A taut, concentrated wine that shimmers with rich layers of flavor, this was built to last. Give it some time, and your patience will be rewarded. Drink 20202035."
"Coming from the Royal Slope, which no doubt will deservedly have its own appellation before long, enchanting aromas of ground rock, green olive, green stem, crushed flower and dark fruit lead to a panoply of fruit and savory flavors that shake the senses to the core, with smoked meat notes persisting on the long finish. It's an intense experience but maintains a sense of balance that is heart stopping. Drink from 2020-2027."
"This wine's gloriously heady notes of lime and lemon zest hit the pleasure center of the brain upon first whiff. That theme of bold, zesty citrus continues with abandon on the taut, linear and concentrated palate. It leaves a lip-smacking, refreshing finish that's loaded with pithiness. If you want refreshment and verve, this is the answer. Lovely now, sure to develop. Drink 20182030."
"This wine is memorable and impressivea ripe exploration of earthy goodness that's rich and velvety smooth. Spicy red fruit seduces amidst a well-developed core of complex orange peel and cardamom highlights, the oak well-integrated and supportive."
"This organically farmed ranch on the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills is producing amazing wines, including this bottling, which combines boysenberry, forest moss, gamy meats and a mud-pit earthiness on the nose. Focused and intense flavors of earth, ripe elderberry, sagebrush and a hint of truffle show on the sip, where the tannins are polished but structurally sound. Drink now2030."
"Dry and nicely mature, this complex wine is always among California's best bubblies. It combines great balance, tiny bubbles and some very interesting flavors that make it as appealing as a well-cellared white Burgundy at its peak. Hints of toast, butter and almond fill the aroma, and lemon, crisp apple and baking spices fill the palate. It has lively acidity that's softened by a good sense of body."
"This wine's nose is shy, allowing just subtle hints of watercress and lemon zest to escape. The palate reveals the full zesty force of lemon: tart but ripe freshness, a lip-smacking pithy, freshness and a concentrated yet streamlined body. Drink now for utter refreshment or wait for it to mellow. The finish is dry and lasting. Drink 20182030."
"Gentle, seductive aromatics combine subtle vanilla, peony and ripe, dark cherry on the nose. The palate is full but freshsvelte one moment, plush the other. There is something seamless in the way the flavors merge, unimpeded by the tannins and their velvety crunch. Highly accomplished, very elegant and quite irresistible. Drink 20202035."
"Pear and melon meld with briny minerality on the palate of this well-integrated, mildly ripe wine. Lasting acidity supports spicy flavors of nutmeg, allspice and anise. The texture is harmonious and focused."
"An earthy touch of wet soil is first to appear in this wine. It's soon replaced by bright lemon zest notes. That lemony freshness stays throughout, brightening the entire palate with fresh, taut, tingling flavor. This is ripe but gloriously tart, finishing on a very pure, lip-smacking and long lemon note. Lovely now, it will evolve. Drink 20182028."
"Bold and spicy, this firmly built wine is the first Morning Dew Ranch vineyard-designate from the new owners of the estate. It starts with exotic and enticing aromas of fresh mint, basil and clove, then delivers pure, focused black fruits and a generous dose of new-oak spice on the palate. Healthy, lip-smacking tannins and firm acidity give it great structure, yet there's no hurry to enjoy this wine. Best after 2020."
"This wine's unlikely combination of passion fruit, wild thyme, lemon zest and fennel seed aromas is totally convincing. On the palate, that same richness is even more apparent. Savory herb and salt notes seem counter a richer, oilier citrus aspect, making for high drama and lots of flavor. Sip, sit back and savor the long, citrus-inflected finish."
"This wine's tender yellow apple notes have an edge of orange and grapefruit zest. Tingling green apple freshness pervades the palate, along with lemon zest notes and a flowing, generous juiciness that almost lets you forget how pithy the flavors actually are. Very streamlined, linear and dry, with a lip-smakcing finish and lots of future promise. Drink 20182030."
"A hedonistic touch of juicy peach swings along with the lemon notes on the nose of this wine. That lovely creamy peachiness also makes for a happy flavor tandem with lemon on the taut, concentrated palate, adding texture and echo. The finish returns to pure, lasting lemon. What a joy. Drink 20182030."
"Reveling in the tannins of a young Cte du Py, this wine is rich, structured and dense. The tannins give the dry edge this wine needs to age. Intense with ripe black fruits, this is a powerful wine. Drink from 2019."
"This wine's nutty, rounded richness and hint of woodsmoke glint in the glass. Its intense citrus freshness, which recalls lemon and orange oil, is tempered by a slight smoky edge. Rotgipfler is one of Austria's rarer indigenous grapes, and this one is particularly unusual, intense and concentrated. It's a party in a glass that's lovely now but will develop. Drink 20182028."
"This wine's fresh green apple notes vie with green Conference pear scents while a flinty touch of reduction promises longevity. The palate shimmers with miso, sage and bright, pure lemon notes, which emphasize darker tones of savory yeast. The combination is totally moreish and effective."
"Consistently one of the winery's top bottlings, aromas of blackberry, black plum, dried herb, anise and spice are followed by supremely rich, tightly wound black fruit and crme de cassis flavors that show a firm grainy handshake of tannins and a warm crazy-long finish. It's all about intensity of expression but what intensity it brings."
"Coming from a vineyard in the Rocks District, aromas of kirsch, black currant, tobacco, spice and mineral are followed by saturated, rich black fruit and smoked meat flavors. It packs a powerful delicious punch."
"This new exciting vineyard is located in the foothills of the Blue Mountains and is filled with cobblestone soils. The aromas explode with notes of raspberry, green and black olive brine, green stem, smoked meat, mineral and earth. The palate is rich and focused, with intense earth, fruit and savory flavors that lead to an extended finish. Abundant floral notes are speckled throughout. It's a stunner."
"The yeasty smell of lees is still present on the nose of this wine, and its lemony fruit struggles to come through. On the palate, however, bright, brisk and pure lemon is in full force. Fruitiness and bitter pith are interwoven, creating a textured mouthfeel of fresh and tart flavors. This still needs to knit together but promises to be a long-lived, concentrated Riesling. Drink now until 2030 or longer."
"The funkiness of lees and fermentation dominate this wine's aroma. On the palate, fresh green and red apple notes shine through, along with a vibrant, pure streak of lemon freshness. It's concentrated yet slender, needing time to show its lemony poise. Drink 20202030."
"This is a warm welcoming wine, resolved in tannin and well-integrated overall. Black licorice, tobacco and clove add to the savory depth of dark, brooding character as an unexpected waft of violet perfume lurks beneath the full-bodied ripeness and concentration."
"Made from grapes sourced from several sites across the appellation, this shows deft winemaking skill in its velvety, gritty texture and beautiful aromas and flavors of cured meat, rose petal and Asian five spice. Bright acidity lifts the tones of cranberry, rhubarb and mushroom earthiness, with a touch of crushed stone."
"Soft vanilla tones overlay fresh, bright passion fruit and rich vanilla notes in this wine, but something more intense lies beneath. The palate reveals great concentration, freshness and intensity, with passion fruit, cream and lemon flavors. Despite the creamy descriptors this is resolutely sveltea real marvel of what mature vines can do. The finish is dry, intense and very long. Drink 20182028."
"The nose is shy but with air it gives way to ripe but tart plum and cherry fruit. On the palate this broadens out into the aromatic hit of Morello and Amarena, kept in tight check by a fine web of gossamer tannins and fresh, bright acidity. This is dense but not extracted, toned but not bulky. This very honestly presented red comes across as totally elegant and wonderfully understated. Impressive but certainly not showy. Drink 20202030."
"Wild berry, camphor, moist earth and violet aromas unfold in the glass. The structured, refined palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, orange slice and white pepper alongside polished tannins and bright acidity. A soothing licorice note lingers on the finish. Drink through 2028."
"An aromatic cloud of orange and lemon zest rises from the glass. With air, the citrus notions become more heady and intense. They perform the same trick on the palate, shimmering in an aromatic array of bergamot, lemon, tangerine and orange. There's a vein of freshness, unforced concentration and the promise of a long future ahead. Drink 20202030."
"This wine's ripe, yellow pear aromas have a savory touch of miso. On the palate, a pleasantly bitter note of citrus pith takes over, adding freshness and texture to complement the savory flavors that give it so much intrigue. It would be simply impossible to not take another sip. The finish is clean, taut and moreish."
"Star anise, pressed rose petal, aromatic herb and camphor are just some of the aromas you'll find on this taut, polished red. The firmly structured, elegant palate delivers sour cherry, pomegranate, licorice and ground clove set against a backbone of fine-grained tannins. It's young but balanced, with bright acidity. Give it time to reach its full potential. Drink 20212033."
"Forest floor, Porcini mushroom, eucalyptus, dark spice and toasted aromas curl out of the glass. It's youthfully austere, offering cranberry, sour cherry and licorice framed in assertive, close-grained tannins. It still needs time to come around and fully bloom. Drink 20242034."
"This wine's pure notes of ripe green pear send enticing signals. The palate adds zesty lemon and floral woodruff touches, creating a green cloud of aroma that fills nose and palate. It's slender and taut in body, its salty midpalate texture beautifully pervaded by citrus brightness. The finish is moreish and totally lip-smacking."
"A heady, tropical touch of passion fruit clings to the more forward citrus notes on the nose of this wine. Lemon and tangerine notes play on the svelte, linear palate. This is totally refreshing and enlivening, with an almost electric lemon verve. Lovely now; sure to evolve. Drink 20182030."
"That salty-sweet aspect of maple syrup makes a brief appearance on the nose before plum, nutmeg and vanilla take over. The body is smooth with elastic but present tannins, the fruit is dense and plush while ample freshness gives both harmony and crunch. It is just on the finish that some alcoholic heat becomes apparent in this very approachable but sophisticated, international style. This is big and bold but brimming with fine fruit. Drink 20202030."
"The Hominis Fides represents some of the estate's oldest Grenache vines, with an average age of 90 years. Irresistibly ripe, rich and mouthfilling, this is a powerhouse of black-plum and cherry flavors refined by layers of pencil shavings, cedar and spice. It's bold and lavishly textured yet has freshness and a fine, filigreed tannin structure. Drink now through 2030."
It's been a long time since Concha y Toro has put out a Don Melchor Cabernet with this much concentration and overall quality. An earthy nose with foresty berry aromas and generous but controlled oak sets up a fully stacked palate that's chewy but not fiercely tannic. Dark toasty chocolaty black-fruit flavors finish with a note of cherry cough drop and moderate acidity that says this is more or less ready now. Drink through 2025.
"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling shows hearty black fruit, peppercorn and a touch of asphalt. Classic Cabernet Franc flavors show through the richness of the palate, with notes of crushed pepper and loamy soil playing up against a boysenberry backdrop."
"This young wine has great potential. It shows weight and a powerful tannic structure as well as bold, ripe black fruits. Coming from the top sector of Morgon, the wine has concentration and richness. It needs to age, and won't be ready before 2019."
"The pear fruit on the nose of this wine is so heady and pristine it almost comes across as candied. It continues on the palate, where it's joined by a fluid and creamy texture, with hints of citrus pith and salt. An intriguing, elegant and taut package. The finish is long and recalls pure lemon zest."
"A touch of yeasty savor appears on the subdued nose of this wine. On the palate, everything seems elevated and poised: there is concentration and texture as well as creamy lemon freshness, deeply savory yeast notes and a salty, herbal tang. This is little pleasure bomb waiting to unfold. Drink 20202030."
"A sublime set of caramel and honeyed late-harvest aromas couldn't be more inviting. This Torontel is the best dessert wine from Chile. It's intense and pure, with acidic balance. Rich amplified flavors of caramel, toffee and cocoa finish with grace on the finish. This is like a trip to Europe: think Vin Santo or Vendange Tardive."
"A ripe, tropical pineapple vibe adds richness to the more customary fruit notes of pear in this wine. The palate broadens into rich, savory miso flavors and leesy texture before being countered by lively, pervading lemon freshness. A big, dramatic wine with incisive brightness. Drink 20292030."
"Very pretty and precise on the nose, this bottling, which is quite delicate for the rich-leaning region, shows candied pomegranate, cinnamon spice, hibiscus and wet gravel on the nose. Wild strawberry and rhubarb flavors pop on the sip, alongside watermelon rind and a very rocky and tense minerality. There is tons of tannic and acidic depth."
"Fresh, almost pristine black cherry beckons from the glass, followed by a gentle whiff of woodsmoke. The medium-bodied palate has the same combination of pristine freshness and gentle oak, showing fresh-faced fruit laced by whisper tannins and delineated by vivid acidity. This is a wonderfully elegant wine with a real force of life inside it. Drink 20182030."
"Citrus foliage, conifer resin and pure lemon zest aromas create an enticing nose in this wine. On the linear palate, riper Mandarin and Meyer lemon notions take hold, creating an immensely juicy, zesty sensation. It's refreshing now, but if you can resist drinking it right away, it will develop beautifully. Drink 20182028."
"Sun-ripened Mirabelle plum and bright lemon zest notes make up this wine's juicy but fresh nose. The palate backs the fruit with textured zestiness and wonderfully forward lemon freshness. It's taut, concentrated and streamlined, its pure lemon notes echoing forever. Gorgeous now but with real potential. Drink 20182030."
"The merest touch of earthy, tarry smoke plays on the closed nose. The body presents a more generous picture of juicy, ripe plum and blackberry fruit, aided by fresh acidity and a finely woven tannic structure. This brims with ripe fruit and is already approachable, but it will develop its alluring aromatics even more."
"A pure note of lemon blossom paves the way for wet earth, tart green apple, citrus foliage and lemon scents in this wine. The palate is similarly ethereal, presenting tender lemon notes against an earthier background. This is all done with an admirably light touch, which suits this linear, taut, dry Riesling well. It's lovely now but will be far more intriguing with some bottle age. Drink 20202030."
"Right away, aromas of spicy black fruits, balsam wood, clove and earth announce a special wine of extra high quality. In the mouth, this is ripe and concentrated (even for a cool year) and ideally balanced. Dark oaky spicy blackberry flavors finish flush, toasty and loaded. Drink through 2028."
"Plum and blackberry notes have a touch of smoke and mocha notes, which mellow on the taut palate. This shows lovely tension between ample fruit and taut freshness, with fine tannins giving a pleasant gauze-like structure. There is warmth and power but both are well contained and held on a tight leash. This shows that well-toned muscle takes you further than mere weight. Drink 20202030."
"An almost maple syrup-like richness comes with the first whiff of cherry fruit on the nose. Similar, more game-like aromatics continue on the concentrated palate that is packed tightly, almost neatly with fruit and fine tannin. This seems compact, with a fine but firm grip. Let it relax for a while, then enjoy its crunchy red-cherry freshness. Drink 20202028."
"A zesty lemon note pervades this wine's lovely Russet pear peel scents. The palate has an equally lithe and elegant feel. The midpalate texture is like taut and delicate lace. Everything is there, but in filigree. The finish is really lip-smacking and fresh."
"The nose wants to give away little but the palate is more forthcoming: red cherry is ripe and crunchy. Firm, structured tannins hold notions of vanilla and pepper while vivid, welcome freshness pervades the entire palate. This is elegant and will come into its own with some bottle age. The ripe but tart cherry leaves a lasting impression on the dry finish. Drink 20202030."
"Citrus foliage and tangerine zest notes play softly on the nose of this wine. The palate fizzes quietly, like a toned-down lemon sherbet. Everything shows that this is a very young wine with great concentration and potential. The lemon note captures the slender, linear palate and creates a lip-smacking finish. Drink 20182030."
"Sun-warmed hay, gentle pear and ripe lemon notes make for a quietly aromatic nose in this wine. That same harmonised touch is also apparent on the almost-creamy palate. Deep, savory citrus pith and hay tones create an understated backdrop for the lovely, gentle fruit. Very elegant from start to finish."
"Mellow yet ripe russet pear notes are spiked with lemon freshness on the nose of this wine. That wonderful and enticing contrast continues on the palate, where the juicy, rounded ripeness of pear and the brisk streak of lemon gain control alternatingly. It makes for exciting, refreshing and joyful drinking. The finish is brisk, clean, lasting and dry. Drink 20182028."
"Mango and passion fruit notes put a rich, tropical spin on the nose of this wine. The palate, on the other hand, offers zesty lemon and salty stone flavors and yeasty texture. Altogether, this makes for a complex, refreshing and captivating wine that sings with concentrated fruit and zestiness. The finish rings long with pure, zesty lemon. Drink 20182030."
"Made for the long haul from one of Otago's most highly respected winemakers, Rudi Bauer, this is drinking well now, offering up a heady mix of raisiny red currants, florals, soy sauce, mushrooms and tree sap. It's medium to full bodied, with a line of focused acidity amidst dusty tannins and a long, cumin and herbal finish. Drink now2027."
"A touch of yeast still mixes with the clean citrus zest notes on the nose of this wine. On the palate, that leesiness cushions the uncompromising pure lemon freshness. It's concentrated in body and dry, vivid and brisk in its flavors, with a stucture that will keep it delightful until 2030, if not longer. Rejoice in the lip-smacking finish."
"This is a new offering from the producer, sparked by winemaker Elias Fernandez's desire to make a Merlot-based blend, rather than a varietal Merlot. It is an estate-grown blend of 56% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Malbec. Rich and concentrated, it's delightfully robust and vibrant, offering a mix of blackberry, blueberry and caramel chocolate flavors that finish in soft, integrated oak."
"A slight touch of flinty reduction accents this wine's fresh lemon zest notes, hinting at how very young it is. These qualities also pervade the taut, linear palate but have an earthier, textured edge. The finish recalls pure lemon zest and has a clean, lip-smacking finale. Drink 20192030."
"Ripe, heady aromas of cassis, raisin and spice cake hold nothing back but aren't overdone. The palate is staunch in feel, with firm but manageable tannins, while this tastes of plum, berry fruits and tomato touched by savory oak. The full yet tight finish offers plenty of balance. Drink through 2025."
"This wine presents as weighty and broad on entry, a successful exploration of juicy black cherry, toasted oak and cardamom that is both succulent and complex. It develops nuance and balance in the glass, with an exotic floral quality that's hard to resist."
"This is yet another stellar vintage of this unique blend, a mix of Muscadelle, Smillon, Colombard and Palomino. Floral as a garden brimming in gardenia, it's dry and gravelly, with distinct flavors of quince and melon. Light on its feet, it's well worth seeking."
"A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah, the aromas draw you into the glass, with light notes of savory herb, cassis, pipe tobacco, spice and crushed rock. It brings a flat-out gorgeous sense of texture, covering the palate from end to end with cherry flavors that glide on the finish. The feel is knee-buckling. Best after 2021."
"This wine is hugely structured and dense, displaying the real heart of Moulin--Vent in its richness. Black plum and spice from wood aging give this wine a ripe character and aging potential. Drink from 2019."
"Fragrant ripe apricot notions hover above the pear and herb base notes of the nose of this wine. On the concentrated palate, they add smooth fluidity to the yeasty, salty, herb-tinged texture. Pure lemon freshness adds welcome and beautiful brightness, making it slender, precise and utterly delicious."
"The appetizing brightness of freshly cut Conference pear engages upon first sniff. The palate then brings a yeasty riff that goes hand-in-hand with luminous lemon flavors, presenting a harmonious balance of lasting savory, creamy and fruity flavors. This shows immense poise and purity."
"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot is all about richness, starting with aromas of vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, licorice and black-currant crme brle. Soft and plush on the palate, the butterscotch, candied blueberry and black plum-syrup flavors are laid across slices of hot spice cake and lifted by mulling spices."
"This is a Merlot-driven blend at 82%, with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. The Merlot is from an older site on Howell Mountain. Spicy nutmeg seasons a soft, rounded palate of integrated tannin and full-bodied but balanced weight, the fruit flavor crisp in cherry, raspberry and cassis, just a touch of butterscotch revealed at the wine's end."
"Quintessential Sangiovese aromas of pressed violet, wild berry, new leather and dark culinary spice pave the way on this delicious wine. Tight and structured, the elegant palate delivers juicy red cherry, licorice and truffle. Bright acidity and assertive, refined tannins provide energy and compelling tension. Drink 20202030."
"Freshly cut green and ripe yellow pear notes appear enticingly on the nose of this wine. The palate takes these along and adds zesty citrus brightness and a spicy herbal tang of sage and celery salt. It's taut, fresh, concentrated and muscular, without any fat."
"A touch of mahogany and bitter almond colors the tight, dark fruit on the nose, which translates as black cherry on the taut, immensely concentrated palate. Fine, drying tannin, warming alcohol and bright acidity highlight the fruit flavors, yet right now there still is a bitter edge of tannin that needs to mellow. The stuffing is there to go the distancethis is a big and muscular wine. Drink 20222032."

"This wine's tart, spiky glints of passion fruit tease the nose amidst all its lemony freshness. With a little air, the passion fruit note grows smoother and fuller. The palate glows in this fruitiness and complements it with creamy richness. It's lovely and seductive now but sure to get even better. Drink 20182028."
"Playing to the tangier side of the grape, this bottling offers dewy sagebrush, barely ripe red currant, white pepper and a hint of tapenade on the nose. The flavors are more rounded with tart cranberry and tangy red-plum skins, enhanced by thyme, dill, green peppercorn and exotic coriander spice. It is very well structured."
"A beautifully evocative red cherry aroma perfumes the nose, joined by a gentle oak tone. The palate has a graceful, fine structure of subtle but firm tannins that frame the rich, ripe red cherry flavor. There still is bite and freshness, making the generous weight appear all the more alluring. A touch of cinnamon makes this feel even more sumptuous. Drink 20202030."
"This is a delicious, dark and suave blend of 32% Syrah, 22% Petite Sirah, 20% Mourvdre, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Viognier. Roasty aromas of cocoa and coffee mesh with elegant and rich black plum on the nose. The palate is wrapped in polished tannins, full of both power and finesse, with black currant, espresso, loamy earth, pepper and chaparral herb flavors."
"From the Haynes Vineyard, this is a beautifully floral wine on the nose, dripping in honeysuckle. Green apple and Bosc pear are deeply interwoven into the softly structured fabric of its balanced ripeness, as ginger and nutmeg highlights provide depth. The acidity is lasting and well mannered through the finish."
"There's a fascinating and lovable rustic quality to this single-vineyard bottling, which is slightly cloudy in the glass and shows aromas of red cherry, hickory smoke, dust and a feral gaminess. That foxy element is prevalent on the sip, with hints of animal hide and dried chaparral set against pomegranate and wild strawberry flavors."
"A touch of leesy freshness clings to the lemon notes on the nose of this wine, revealing how very young it still is. The palate has a textured mouthfeel that owes as much to yeast as it does to lemon zestiness. With its great concentration, it still needs time to unfurl the full force of its citrus power. The finish is incisive, long and lemony. Drink 20202030."
"Earth, yeast and saltiness color the lemony freshness of this wine's aroma. They also give a funky twirl to the palate, which shines with tart but ripe red apple and orange flavors. Underneath is a bright vein of lemon zest. It pulls the focus into the long finish, which tingles long after you have swallowed. Drink 20202030."
"Lovely notes of black cherry on the nose have a pleasant edge of bitter almond. The palate is dense with that same aromatic cherry and has both ample power and concentration to make this a rather muscular, potent wine. The tannins are fine and have a soft but distinct grip, with a warming, long finish. Drink 20222032."
"Fragrant green notes inform the nose of this wine: there are moss and sage, citrus foliage and fern scents. That herbal richness also plays on the slender, fresh and streamlined palate. Citrus freshness emanates from the textured flavors, softened slightly by salty yeast notes. An impressive, concentrated wine with lots of potential. Drink 20182028."
"This wine's clean, ripe yellow pear notes stream from the glass, accentuated even more by bright, lemony freshness. This fruity combo continues throughout the slender, lithe palate, which reveals intriguing celery salt and fennel seed notes as you slowly savor. It is made all the more precise by fresh, lemon-like acidity. Gorgeous now but sure to develop. Drink 20182028."

"The nose of this wine is still subdued. Hints of wet earth and pure lemon notes can barely be discerned. With a few swirls of the glass, tender hints of blood orange zest pervade nose and palate, alongside spiky, bright lemon notes. The body is slender and taut but brims with gorgeous citrus aromas. Lovely now but sure to last. Drink 20182030."
"A deep color and thick aromas of blackberry and black fig lead to opulent mouth-filling dark-fruit flavors and a velvety substantive texture. This wine ranks with Turley and Carlisle Petite Sirahs at the top of the quality pyramid in California. It has all the expected tannin along with oodles of fruity, smoky richness to stand up to it. Best through 2028."
"This stunning white is sourced from a handful of sources, including the producer's estate, but also Hyde Vineyard in Carneros, Stagecoach on Atlas Peak, and several sites on Sonoma Mountain. It offers a demure nose of honeysuckle and peach before allowing room for lemon, quince and dried herb to come forth on the creamy palate, finishing bright and fresh in acidity."
"Almost black in the glass, this rich and dense bottling impresses immediately with aromas of black currant, caramel, spearmint and wet slate. It's soft and velvety on the palate and loaded with flavors of roasted coffee, shaved chocolate and black plum pudding. Tannins uphold the weight perfectly."
"This is the first release of this wine from this new producer based in Napa. Made by Steve Matthiasson, it is a bleed of Cabernet Franc grapes grown in Carneros, Oak Knoll and Yountville that's both exuberant and expressive in candied cherry and tart orange. Barrel-aged in steel barrels, it offers fully realized acidity in a tightly wound package of pure quenchability."
"Fresh celery and dried fennel seed notes play against a backdrop of pear-fruited freshness on the nose of this wine. These qualities are repeated on the light, translucent and refreshing palate. There is something quite disarming about so much flavor in such a lithe body. Simply lovely."
"From a prime vineyard along Westside Road, this is a restrained take on a warm site and concentrated vintage, with beautiful floral aromas at its heart.

"This is an inaugural release, blended with 7% Merlot and aged 22 months in French oak, 65% new. From vines grown predominantly in the northern end of the valley (Calistoga and St. Helena), it features a grainy texture of bold dark cherry that's granular and focused on the palate. Tobacco and leather add to the savory nature of the billowy tannin power. Enjoy best 20202030."
"There is a savory, gamy touch to the red cherry aroma on the nose. The palate counters this with crunchy, vivid cherry flavors, with a fine tannic grip offering a wild but alluring quality. A very individual but beautiful expression of this grape. Drink 20192030."
"Blended with 10% Petit Verdot, this age-worthy beauty is impressively oaked and tannic in its youth, with a concentration of densely packed red and black currants. Coconut shavings and vanilla appear from the background alongside black pepper and cinnamon. This should drink best from 20242034."
"A touch of lemon, a whisper of pineapple. This combines ripeness and freshness on a palate that's concentrated yet slender and taut. Glimpses of much riper fruit appear; orange, apple and russet pear shimmer and wait. You should wait a little, too, for this elegant, fluid and slender Riesling. Drink 20202030."
"This wine's fresh citrus foliage, lemon zest and fragrant conifer notes make for a highly aromatic opening.

Lovely now, it will only get better. Drink 20182030."
"Aromatic, ripe blueberry notes entice the nose. The merest hint of licorice and tar tingles around the edges.

There is so much vigor and easy charm, a fresh-faced, unforced and disarmingly honest wine. Yet there is nothing facile. Lovely. Drink 20182028."
"A seductive and well-integrated veil of earthy spicecinnamon stick, fruit cake, bark, black tea leafsits atop a ripe core of red berry and cherry fruits. Beneath that is a strong gravelly, flinty minerality that pervades the palate and expresses strongest on the finish. Medium weight, the tannins are firm yet fine, resulting in a rich, velvety texture. A beautiful and complex expression, this should continue to develop and unfold additional layers of flavor through 2031."
"The sonorous and soft vanilla notes of oak provide a beautiful backdrop for all the blueberry aromas that rise from the glass.

"Dark and dense aromas of blackberry and black currant meet with tar, black pepper, tapenade and plush violet on the nose of this fascinating wine, which treads the line between piquantly savory and richly ripe. The palate shows sour black plums, crushed peppercorns and seared lamb flavors against a dense black-fruit background."
"Charming, just-ripe fruit flavors and a silky texture make this wine elegant and polished. It has a lighter color than average, but that doesn't make the generous black cherry and rose petal flavors any less gorgeous, or the medium-body and good acidity any less appetizing. It's a beauty from one of Anderson Valley best sites."

This a classic Barbaresco with years ahead of it. Drink 20212038."
"After some time in the glass the 2014 Bric Turot reveals complex aromas of wild berry, dark spice, blue flower and balsamic notes. The elegantly structured, energized palate is even more expressive than the nose, delivering ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and star anise.

There is concentration and a fine tannic weave alongside bright freshness. This has fruit, structure and balance and was made with a knowing, light touch but needs time to unfold. It carries its weight well and will blossom. Drink 20222032."

The palate is also subdued in flavor, but presents a firm structure of fine tannin and a spine of bright freshness, balancing out alcoholic warmth. This needs to develop and unfold, all the harmony is already there, the fruit just needs to come out of its shell. Drink 20222030."

The finish is wonderfully spicy and clean."

"A heady whiff of woodsmoke combines with aromatic cherry fruit on the nose. The beautifully taut palate allows freshness to show the purity of the fruit.

"Redcurrant, blue flower, cedar and a hint of pine forest are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant red. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the bright, savory palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry, tobacco and white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins while a licorice note graces the close. Enjoy through 2027."
"Theodora Lee is making brilliant wines from her estate property in Mendocino County. Great concentration and a monumental structure help this wine stand out, even in a field crowded with those qualities. It tastes a little quiet and tight now, and needs time to mellow so that more complexity and richness comes out. Still, it already shows intriguing layers of black pepper, black fig, blueberry and graphite. Best after 2025."
"A stellar example of freshness from a richer region, this bottling offers buoyant and snappy raspberry fruit on the nose alongside dewy forest floor, tangy juniper, soft rose petals and a hint of nutmeg. Fresh and invigorating on the palate, the sip shows tart raspberry, crushed thyme, green peppercorn and tapenade flavors."
"Hints of coffee, earth, smoke and spice highlight cool, crisp blackberry and cherry flavors in this wine. It's fragrant and fresh, with a vibrant core of acidity and firm tannins that feel taut and thrilling. While beautiful already, its concentrated fruit and mineral complexities should meld from 2021 and continue to improve through 2030."
"From a challenging vintage at times, a tiny amount of this subdued wine was made. The nose offers a sense of peatiness, like a good Scotch. Tart orange and grapefruit define an essential crispness to the fruit, as crushed rock and rose petal play along. The tannins and oak are soft and seamlessly interwoven."
"A faint note of lemon zest plays on the tender nose of this wine. On the palate, lemon takes over, accented by a richer edge of pineapple. It's zesty, brisk and concentrated, providing spine and spark, with a clean, citrus-focused and moreish finish. Drink 20202030."
"The price-to-flavor ratio on this bottling is astounding, as this blend of 55% Syrah, 27% Zinfandel, 13% Petite Sirah and 5% Petite Verdot offers all that Paso power at half the price. Intense black currant, blackberry pie, beef jerky and caramel aromas lead onto a palate full of chalky tannins and balanced acidity. The roasted blackberry flavors would pair perfectly with a beef stew."
"Bright black raspberry aromas meet with shaved licorice, fresh fennel, tarragon and purple rose petals on the nose of this single vineyard expression. The sip dries up considerably at first, with loamy, minty flavors, but they open toward strawberry, sumac and candied red cherry. Cinnamon and menthol spice fire up the finish."
"Aromatic notes of ripe red berries and much more tart Morello cherries play on the nose, joined by a faint hint of woodsmoke. The palate is beautifully translucent in pure cherry fruit, with a graceful structure of very fine tannins. Both ripeness and extraction are beautifully judged here. Lovely already but sure to evolve. Drink 20182028."
Hazelnut-like oak notes still dominate the nose of this wine. The palate counters them with friendly mirabelle plum fruit and ample lemon freshness. This needs time to integrate and unfold but has all the necessary balance and stuffing to do just that. Drink 20202030.
"After skipping a vintage, the producer offers this impressively powerful expression of the variety from a great site. Compressed plum and strawberry compote flavors are rich and rounded, nuanced in juicy acidity. A lasting bite of oak and tannin permeate on the long finish, accented in white pepper."
"Candied blackberry, black cherry, plum paste, mint and dark chocolate show on the nose of this dense built-to-last bottling by Mike Officer. The palate is thick and the tannins are still a bit stiff, but the intense marjoram, oregano, thyme and elderberry jam flavors will grow even more fascinating with time. Drink from 2019 through 2035."
"Sbastien Gutty is proud owner of this three-acre parcel of 90-year-old vines. They have given a wine that reflects both richness and concentration. It is densely packed with dark tannins, black fruits and a shot of acidity. This is a wine to drink from 2019."
"The nose on this bottling is both juicy and serious, with cherry, pomegranate, dewy morning sagebrush, muddy sand and star anise aromas. There is solid textural tension to the sip, where red currant and lavender flavors mesh. Strong acidity soars into the finish."
"Layers of spice, vanilla and toast are integrated from nose to palate in this elegant Condrieu. It's an unctuous, textured sip marked by silken waves of orange water, blossom and cream. The acidity is soft but lemony, lending freshness to a salty, savory hazelnut finish."
"This is a big, rich wine, full of tannins as well as intense fruit. Concentration and dense texture are just part of the fruitiness and structure that give this wine its potential. Still developing, the wine is likely to show at its best from 2019."
"Fermented with natural yeasts and with little added sulphur, this wine concentrates on its fruit character. Fine tannins, rich black fruits and a dense texture all contribute to its distinctiveness. With its structure and acidity it does need to age. Drink from 2019."
"This large, 61-acre, vineyard forms part of the Piron properties. The wine has great concentration and a dense ripe texture that comes from low-yielding, 50-year-old vines. Let this wine fill out even more. Drink from late 2018."
"This wine has that lovely mix of citrus zest and pith on both the nose and palate. The two vie for attention, giving both freshness and texture. The flavors are highlighted by lemon but also informed by greener, savory hints of ivy, celery and fennel. White pepper makes an intriguing appearance on the dry finish."
"Delicious fruitiness and full body are a winning combination in this luxuriously oaky, very ripe-tasting and impressive wine from Marin Countynot exactly a household name for wine, but it should be. The black cherry and stewed-plum flavors are so rich they seem sweet, but a good structure of acidity and firm tannins keeps the wine balanced."
"There is extreme florality throughout this bottling, starting with wisteria and dark carnations on the bright and fresh nose, alongside black raspberry fruit. The flowers are a bit more subdued on the sip, yet violet, lilac and rosewater flavors persist, decorating the suave strawberry and rhubarb background."
"Russet pear peel and citrus pith notes hovers above the savory, yeasty nose of this wine. The palate then gives full rein to wonderully rounded, salty soy notes, which ring with citrus freshness and ripe pear notes through the midpalate. Beautifully balanced, concentrated and very appetizing."
"Fragrant and refined, this radiant red opens with enticing scents of wild berry, aromatic herb, dark spice, menthol and whiffs of tilled soil and pressed blue flower. Ethereally elegant and boasting great tension, the palate delivers succulent red cherry, raspberry, clove and a hint of licorice while vibrant acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins lend balance and support. Drink through 2024."
"Even in old-vine Beaujolais terms, vines planted in 1935 are rare. These come from a small parcel within the Grand Cras sector of Morgon and produce a richly concentrated wine. With firm tannins, ripe black fruits and balanced acidity, this dense wine needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"An aromatic streak of wild cherry flashes up on the nose and completely takes over on the smooth palate. This is structured by finely woven tannins, corsetting the beautifully judged fruit. At the perfect juncture of freshness and ripeness, this brims with sensuous, red cherry fruit."
"A creamy, subdued ripe pear aroma is the first impression this wine gives. The palate counters with ample freshness and a wonderfully textured mouthfeel that combines cream, fruit, celery salt and citrus pith notes. All the concentration is cushioned with generous fruit and invigorating freshness."
"A flinty touch of reduction colors the pear and yeast notes on the nose of this wine. The palate shows all the characteristic savory richness of yeast, but here it seems to sparkle with lightness and brisk, lemony freshness, finishing on savory notes of sage and fennel. Although slender, it's full of flavor."
"The aromas are sweet and sappy, with notes of raspberry, herb, pipe tobacco and musk. The palate shows more restraint than the aromas might suggest, bringing a suave sense that carries through a finish that just won't quit. It's equal parts intrigue and delivery, bringing a lot of richness."
"This is a 100% varietal wine, juicy and broad on the palate with mouth-filling tannins that show its youthful vigor. Cherry and raspberry liqueur flavors run deep, wrapped in sizable oak and well-integrated accents of cedar and dried herb. This stands to be cellared; enjoy best 2024 through 2029."
"Savory tones of tobacco leaf, dried lavender and thyme lend a dark, sultry appeal to rich blackberry and plum here. This wine is fleshy on the palate yet firmly balanced with fine, taut tannins and a lingering, brambly finish. Graceful and nuanced, it should drink at prime through 2030."
"A touch of reduction still lets this come across as brooding. But lemon zest and dried hay flower flavors come to the fore with a little air. The concentrated midpalate boasts zestiness and a yeasty texture. This will deliver joy, poise and refreshment with its pervasive lemon notes. Drink 20202030."
"If you know Matetic Syrah, then this will be like an old friend coming back for a visit. The nose is earthy and dense, with the winery's patented mix of heady herbal fruit and eucalyptus aromas. A chewy palate spreads its wings with grace and strength, while this tastes of toasty oak, medicinal black fruits and minty herbs. Drink through 2022."
"Plenty of up-front oak makes for a nose with char and smoke on top of perfumed black fruit. A profoundly deep palate is fairly tannic and firm. Flavors of black plum, dark chocolate, herbs and pepper finish more dry than jammy, with tea and wood spice notes. Drink through 2025."
"Pure notes of crushed blueberry have a wonderfully tart edge, almost like wild little huckleberries. The same, pure and intense fruit spreads across the textured body where fine and ever so slightly rustic tannins crunch pleasurably. This wine shows the juicy, almost voluptuous ripeness of 2015 without ever losing freshness or tone. This should come with some sort of pleasure warning. Simply delicious. Drink 20182025."
"This Syrah has an old-world soul, with pronounced earthy scents of game, tobacco leaf, chicory root and loads of white pepper that grace notes of black cherry and raspberry fruit. The velvety palate boasts smooth yet enduring tannins, while flavors of charred animal hide, cherry skin and forest floor carry through to the long, evolving finish, ending with a soft sanguine accent. While it's enticing now, it should mature gracefully through 2028."
"This wine combines so much of what we've come to love about New Zealand Pinot. It's light and bright but serious too, with plenty of site expression. Raspberry and blueberry compote, violets, baking spices and sun-baked stones all dance together on the nose. There's plush fruit on the palate but a savoriness too, framed by sinewy tannins and finishing on a stoney, mineral note."
"A shy, restrained nose hints at red cherry, red plum and cherry juice. The palate, on the other hand, brims with aroamtic cherries: black and red, ripe and luscious but always fresh. It is the slender freshness and appealing texture of fine tannin that makes this both elegant and moreish. Wonderfully concentrated but somehow understated despite its juiciness."
"This wine goes to the limit with ripeness and full body, showing an especially dark color, very ripe and effusive fruit flavors like macerated cherries and blackberry jam and a mouth-filling texture packed with lots of expansive tannins. It's hard to resist its exuberance and concentration."
"This wine is ripe, structured, full of fruit and rich. It also is elegant, with a spacious texture and smooth fruit full of black-plum flavors. Drink this wine now."
"This wine's beautiful red and yellow apple fruit has a zesty edge of lemon. On the palate, a more textured element reminiscent of apple peel and lemon pith adds body. Freshness pervades the wonderfully elegant and earthy flavors. The finish is bright, dry and fresh with lemon. Lovely now, it's sure to develop. Drink 20182028."
"A touch of wet earth colors the lemony notes on the nose of this wine. On the palate, the lemon becomes even more intense and concentrated. It's a ripe, fruity kind of freshness that recalls Meyer lemon and leaves the palate envigorated with mouthwatering but spiky richness."
"Aged in large wooden barrels called foudres, this wine is smoothly textured as well as generous in its fruitiness. Great red fruits are surrounded by young tannins and touches of wood aging. With its rich texture, the wine will need time. Drink from late 2018."
"This is a beautiful Pinot from one of New Zealand's most acclaimed biodynamic producers. Plummy fruit, florals, dried leaves, white pepper and a hint of cinnamon lead into a light- to medium-bodied palate that is crisp and elegant yet powerful too, with grainy, almost chewy tannins, a warm stone character, and a long, tangy finish. Still youthful, this should go for another 79 years. Drink through 2027."
"A touch of ripe melon colors the more usual pear notes on the nose of this wine. Here, they're pure and pristine. That same fruity pear perfume characterizes the creamy palate, along with a yeasty texture and pithy citrus richness. A highly elegant, svelte style, with friendly, delicious fruit."
"A touch of soy, a spark of lemon and friendly ripe pear notes combine on the nose of this wine. That harmonized interplay continues on the concentrated palate, where lemony brightness and yeasty, soy-like richness play off each other to great effect. The finish is taut and refreshing."
"This opens with a strong herbal impression, redolent of fresh fynbos, tilled earth, frankincense and violet, which mix harmoniously with the wild strawberry and boysenberry fruit core. The medium-weight palate is bright and juicy, with a crushed-satin texture thanks to ample acidity and structured yet fine tannins. The pure finish leads with ripe fruit flavors that transition seamlessly to notes of sweet spice and finally a fresh, salty sea-spray accent. It's easy to like now, but it should hold well through 2028."
"Of the vineyard designated wines, this one comes from the youngest vines, planted in 1998. The aromas of peach, pear, mineral, pineapple upside down cake and spice are subtle and refined. The palate is sleek yet silky and extremely flavorful, full of stone-fruit flavors that lead to a finish that won't quit. It's all about delicacy and restraint, hitting a lot of high notes."
"A touch of russet apple peel plays with the lemon notes on the nose of this wine, suggesting riper, juicier fruit that is made manifest on the palate. Full-fruited, juicy red apple, yellow pear and ripe Meyer lemon notes abound and dance aromatically on the palate. It all comes together on a pithy vein of citrus freshness. This is exuberant and joyful and will evolve if you can actually resist drinking it. Drink 20182028."
"Fresh, bright hints of Golden Delicious apples meet zesty lemon notes and a wet pebble stoniness on the nose of this wine. With air, the fruit grows more insistent.

"This Syrah-based blend is ripe, flush and sets a new high-water mark for Via Maipo, part of the Concha y Toro group. On the palate, this is jammy, deep and complete, with layering. Flavors of toasty oak, graphite, wood spice and blackberry end with oak-aided coffee, mocha and chocolate notes. Drink this concentrated Syrah-Cabernet blend through 2022."
"Exotic spice, toast, crushed mint, French oak and black-skinned berry aromas follow over to the linear, elegant palate along with wild cherry and licorice. It's youthfully austere but well balanced, with fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 20192033."
"A mere whisper of rose flashes on the nose before herbal, yeasty fruitiness takes over. This field blend is intriguing and layered, made from several varieties. The palate has a salty edge and a rich mouthfeel that veers from creamy to pithy and back again. It lets its yeasty pear, apple and citrus flavors ripple across the tongue. Lovely now but sure to evolve. Drink 20182025."
"A richly ripe and rewarding white, this wine opens in hearty notions of butter, quince and spicy peach. Velvety smooth, it has a decadence that persists and impresses, its use of oak integrated and complementary to the wine's gravelly elements."
"From a vineyard known better for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this lovely aromatic white is well crafted and fruity, dry with a creaminess to the texture that's beguiling without becoming too much. Lemon, quince and apricot flavors provide a bright, lingering fleshiness that will work deliciously at the table. It spent six months in neutral French oak."
"This wine's fresh, fruity nose is most inviting, recalling freshly cut Conference pear and the lovely tang of miso and yeast. The palate is evenly balanced between yeasty, salty savoriness and the yellow and green pear notes, creating a lively and full-flavored white with a long, dry finish."
"There's a lot of wild thyme, dusty creek bed and rainy cement on the nose of this bottling, with only the slightest hint of cranberry fruit. The palate's tension is tremendous, which is common for the appellation, with crushed sandstone and rugged earthiness cloaking the cran-hibiscus flavors. It's lightly bodied but firm with upright tannins."
"A pure streak of freshly cut green pear on the nose promises a bight, lively wine. The palate is indeed bright and slender, dominated by that pure, lithe, lifted pear note. It's fruit-driven but elegant and understated. The finish is both lemon-fresh and smooth."
"Aromas of truffle, mocha, scorched earth, toast and baked plum slowly take shape in the glass. Succulent and smooth, the generous, polished palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon, crushed mint and licorice framed in velvety tannins. It's already delicious and accessible but still offers good mid-term aging. Drink through 2023."
"This wine that comes from three different parcels has an open style, ripe with berries and rich flavors. The style is rich and concentrated, with a solid core of tannins. This wine could well age, and it will be best from 2019."
"Earthen notes of freshly tilled soil and garrigue lend depth to plump strawberry and blackberry in this bold yet nuanced wine. It's sunny and pliant on the palate, but fine, feathery tannins linger persistently, along with piquant hints of anise and leather. It drinks well already but should hold nicely through 2027."
"All the pent-up power inherent in a Morgon awaits in this wine. With dense tannins and concentration from the 85-year-old vines, this still-structured wine is packed with ripe black fruits. The juicy acidity gives a crisp edge, although the wine will need to age until 2019."
"Les Capitans is one of the top sectors of Saint-Amour, producing wines that are perfumed and have great fruit. This wine also has some firm tannins that add to the richness. It is likely to age well and, with its juicy acidity, will be best from late 2018."
"Produced from vines that are more than 50 years old, this wine is concentrated and dense. It also has the great style and elegance that is the hallmark of Fleurie. Black fruits are cut with good acidity, giving a juicy character to balance the ripe tannins. This beautiful wine will be ready to drink from late 2018."
"A youthful aroma of peardrop is foremost on the nose, but on the palate, a zesty, pithy texture takes over. It's accompanied by vivid, lively lemon freshness that keeps it slender and streamlined, ringing with purity and verve. The finish is moreish and lip-smacking."
"A tropical hit of pineapple precedes the lemony notes on the nose of this wine. The palate is utterly pure and fresh, with slender and poised lemon notes that carry fluidly and mouthwateringly into the long finish. There is something salty, lip-smacking and very refreshing about this. Drink 20182028."
"The merest hint of passion fruit gives a tropical twist to the lemony nose of this wine. The palate comes in with fresh juiciness, combining ripe yellow and tart green apple notes. There's an intense and deeply fruity aroma that sweeps from ripe pear and crunchy apple to ripe orange and zesty lemon. Lovely, pure and sure to evolve. Drink 20282028."
"Passion fruit-like tropical notes dominate the nose of this wine, but the palate predominantly expresses lemon, herbs and salt. Its citrusy freshness tingles on the textured midpalate, opening into richer soy, miso and preserved lemon notes. The body is taut and fresh and the finish long."
"This winery is packaging the freshness and restraint that's possible in this region, with this bottling offering aromas of pomegranate, red currant and star anise on the nose. The palate is vibrant with red fruit, yet it is the bay leaf, wild mint and fennel pollen flavors that impress most and carry deep into the finish."
"From the coastal ridges of the appellation, this lovely wine is tart in strawberry, pomegranate and orange, with a beautiful floral element that lifts the pronounced acidity and darker, more savory forest-floor tones. Spicy and complex, it hits the palate with an intriguing twist of sea spray."
"The nose is both sonorous and toned with vanilla hints meeting tart, dark fruit. The palate plays a similar game of soft, mellow oak meeting concentrated black and red fruit which is ripe but still has bite. Hints of tar and cinnamon shimmer darkly, while fine tannins, warm alcohol and bright acidity make the mouth water. This is quite a mouthful and will benefit from mellowing. These muscles are all still tightly flexed. Wait for this to relax and drink 20222032."
"Oak notes of roast chestnut and mocha dominate the nose for now and signal a potent wine. The palate is dense with dark plum and black cherry. The fruit is concentrated and the tannins are fine but firm. A streak of fine, pure acidity pulls these elements together and brightens and lightens this brooding wine. The genie in this bottle is still asleep but will show itself with elegance and restrained power with some bottle age. Drink 20202028."
"Snappy boysenberry meets with vanilla, roasted chocolate and purple flowers on the nose of this bottling, which is made by a Texas-based producer. There is great peppery spice to the sip, where dried herbs and roast beef give depth to the black-currant flavors. Lively acidity and polished tannins complete the picture."
"A tart kind of ripeness recalling zesty orange and crisp yellow apple creates immediate appetite on the nose of this wine. The palate follows through with fizzing lemon and lime zestiness, great concentration and a rich, leesy texture. The finish is dry, lipsmacking and wonderfully refreshing."
"Blueberry and conifer, a slight whiff of woodsmoke and plum. These are the lovely aromas that pervade nose and palate of this taut, finely structured red. The tannins crunch while the fruit has a really ripe aspect that only becomes apparent with some of the alcoholic warmth on the palate. Everything is so well integrated but still tight. This needs a little bottle age to come into itself. Something to look forward to. Drink 20202030."
"A seriously structured wine from this fine vintage will surely have good aging potential. This wine is ripe, dense with tannins and rich with blackberry fruits. It makes a powerful statement about the longevity of Morgon wines. Drink from 2019."
"This wine was grown at a mere 1.2 tons per acre and spent 20 months in the barrel aging on lees in 60% new puncheons. The aromas are brooding on first pour, with notes of blackberry, mineral, fresh herb, potpourri and barrel spice. The palate is incredibly dense and rich, with a lick of tannins on the warm finish. It's a big wine, made in a muscular powerful style."
"Coming from the Rocks District, this wine is a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah.

"An herbal hint of crushed mint and thyme hovers above bright lemon scents in this wine. The palate is fluid and swishes across the tongue like a caress. The finish lingers forever with a dreamy, pure lemon note. Simply lovely."
"Ripe red apple and orange zest richness create a fresh, appetizing aroma in this wine. The palate comes in with even more freshness, adding green apple tartness and lively, translucent lemon notes, with a pithy, zesty texture. A very original, refreshing and moreish wine quite outside its varietal idiom, it delivers loads of impact and flavor for such moderate alcohol. Bravo."
"All the joy of ripe but tart apple is expressed here, supported by lemon freshness. This is as fruity as it is fresh, and the contrast between these two poles creates delicious excitement. An incredibly lively, energetic wine with a dry, zesty and moreish finish."
"From the Stewart Vineyard in Carneros, planted with the Musqu clone, this white is spicy and sublimely textured, with a persistence of mineral mystique and balanced ripeness. Its well-crafted fruitiness is a mix of white peach and lime."
"Wonderful complexity and an appealing earthiness help this mouth-watering wine stand out.

"Despite this wine's shy nose, it loses no time in presenting ripe, rounded and aromatic pear fruit on the palate, which is made more precise by bright lemon freshness. That zestiness pervades the concentrated palate and underlines the juiciness of its yellow pear fruit. The finish is dry and clean, with lasting freshness. Drink 20182028."
"There's an impressive density to the aromas of this blend of 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah, 15% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec, with ample amounts of black plum, lilac and damp forest wood. The palate's hearty structure carries ample purple fruit as well as dark chocolate, thyme marjoram and rainbow peppercorn flavors. Quite thick with tannins."
"Inviting aromas of wild berry, violet and sandalwood are front and center.

A fantastic showing and unusually expressive for the cool, wet vintage."

The medium-weight palate offers great acidity that enlivens the ripe fruit flavors, while a saline impression provides further lift and lingers long on the close. Drink now2021."
"There's no reason to drink Cabernet all the time when delicious, well-balanced and firm-textured California Tempranillos like this are becoming more and more common. From a specialist in Iberian grape varieties, the wine has lightly spicy aromas, nicely layered red- and black-cherry and wood-smoke flavors that fill the mouth and linger on the finish."
"Invigorating freshness sets this impeccably balanced Viognier apart in a flight of peers. Crisp yellow peach, mango and orange flavors are pristine and cutting, accented by subtle vanilla, spice and marshmallow. It's primary and fruity without restraint, yet elegantly composed in heft and body."
"An impenetrable, teeth-staining purple, the 2014 Le Sol is calling out for a cozy sweater and a fireplace. Intense woodsy aromas of cedar, pine needles, blackberry jam, medicinal herbs and smoky undertones lead into a palate that's herbal, juicy-fruited and framed by powerful, chewy tannins. The oak is on show at the moment but will settle with time. Drink now2027."

Brawny in leather saddle, clove, dark chocolate and a substantial backbone of dense tannin, it's also rounded and fleshy in black cherry and cassis, with fresh, focused acidity."

It's quite deep in color, very fruity in aroma, full in body and with nice depth to the ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors.

The body is full and the texture feels smooth, but with a good touch of crisp acidity."
"Great structure and a brilliant sense of restraint make this vividly flavored and medium-bodied wine a keeperand nearly as good as the winery's vineyard designates.

"Te Mata's most renowned wine takes some time to open in glass. When it does, its many subtleties start to shine and it shows both its muscularity and its delicacy. Trademark florals lead the pack, closely followed by notes of black-currant and blackberry jam, graphite, tobacco and hot stones. The palate leads with tart fruit but quickly blends with the savory, dusty notes of the oak and chewy, pencil lead tannins. Finishes on the oaky side right now but will age for many years. Drink now2027."
"Very rich and ripe, but also very firm and well built, this full-bodied wine has all the elements for great balance: robust and dry fruit flavors, good acidity, firm but not harsh tannins and appropriately strong alcohol.

"This kitchen-sink blend, which includes nine different varieties, is superbly pretty right from the start, with tremendous floral scents that flood the bouquethoneysuckle, jasmine, apple blossom and fresh fynbos.

"Dry earthy aromas of black fruits are subtle and calm, not loud, oaky or overtly herbal or spicy. A bit of clamp is found on a firm palate, while this Bordeaux blend tastes of spicy, lightly herbal plum and berry fruits. A steady thorough finish feels right. Drink through 2022."
"While this is currently slightly tight and closed, it shows the structure and elements to present a complete and well-balanced wine with a little time.

"A full-fruit nose with grapy aromas of boysenberry and not much oak character gets this low-alcohol (12.5%) Cabernet off to an unconventional start.

Drink through 2020."

"Over one million cuttings from the Matthews Lane Vineyard have been supplied to nurseriesand therefore wineriesaround Marlborough, so in theory, there's a small piece of it in many of the wines from the region.

Lovely freshness on the finish makes for a bright, long aftertaste."

"Ripe, juicy cassis and blackberry notes seduce from nose to finish here. It's a brawny, rather lavish wine, both in body and fruit, but nuanced too, accentuated by hints of garrigue, leather and earth. Richly concentrated and long on the finish, it's framed neatly by fine, persistent tannins."
"Sanguine and smoky, this wine has a welcome herbal component that keeps it fresh and complex in the glass. Thick and densely concentrated in blackberry and plum, it persists in an underlying vibrancy that helps balance and complement its more luxurious tease of dark chocolate."

"Fully concentrated in dusty black fruit and tobacco, this blends 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot, 2% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Mellowed in terms of ripeness and body weight, it offers sizable tannins that provide structure along the midpalate."
"The aromas explode with notes of honeysuckle, ripe peach, apricot and creamsicle. The flavors are supremely rich but also show a beautiful sense of delicacy along with a pronounced finish. It's full bore but delicious."
"Ripe black-fruit aromas are nicely toasted and subtle. On the palate, this is chewy and concentrated but not too heavy. Darkchocolaty oaky blackberry flavors are just spicy and feral enough to let you know this is Syrah. As a whole, this is smooth and ready to drink."
"There's a potent smoky character on the nose of this bottling, with hickory and oak aromas wrapped around the strawberry and plum flavors.

"Cherry syrup and a roasted meat element are revealed the nose of this bottling from a winery with a popular tasting room in downtown Paso Robles.

The mouthfeel is easygoing and airy, with flavors of tart berry, plum skins and more garden herbs. A peppery spice extends through the finish."
"A tiny production wine from a backbone site, used in many of the producer's other wines, this is brash in coconut and black currant, the tannins grainy and firm, given additional heft by the ripeness and generous use of oak. Velvety smooth, it's densely packed in black pepper and clove."
"Mint and violet notes accent a dense black-cherry core in this full-bodied, juicy wine. Light touches of baking spices and dried herbs add complexity and play into a layering effect on the palate."

"Aromas of wild berry, tilled soil, new leather, camphor and a whiff of violet take center stage on the nose. Bright and succulent, the vibrant, graceful palate doles out juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry and baking spice. Taut, refined tannins and racy acidity lend balance and tension. Fans of elegance will love its ethereal finesse. Drink 20192026."
"With a waxy nose of peach and apricotboth dried and freshthis is a dry, light-bodied wine that dances on the palate in moderately high acidity. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it remains softly textured and vibrant from start to finish."
"This is a beautifully balanced wine with medium body and nicely firm tannins supporting fairly rich black fruits and herbal accents. It is sleek and agile rather than big and rich, and its appetizing texture should make it really versatile at lunch or dinner."
"Earthy aromas of pepper spice, roasted meat crust and red cherry sauce show on the nose of this bottling from a new property in Ojai. The flavors are clean yet pleasantly rustic, full of cooked herbs, dust and rounded cranberry. It's light in body, soft in texture and easy to drink."
"While this displays dark aromas of burnt oak, road tar and blackberry, the palate is not heavy or overly hard driving. Plum and berry flavors are loaded with wood spice and nutmeg accents, while this tastes chocolaty on a bold finish. Drink this exemplary Carignan through 2025."
"Menthol, mature black-skinned fruit, clove, pressed violet and balsamic aromas take shape in the glass. The linear, elegantly structured palate is youthfully austere, offering tart red cherry, cranberry and licorice alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 20202033."
"This blend of 55% Grenache Blanc and 45% Viognier is one of the zippiest white wines you can find. It's restrained on the nose with honeydew, yellow grapefruit peel and wet slate aromas, and then the wound-up acidic power explodes on the sip, where tart apple and pear flavors linger behind the sizzle."
"This wine is thick and sinewy, ripe and soft in texture. Spicy clove, pepper and cinnamon highlight a richness of strawberry puree and mocha chocolate flavor, the oak subdued in the background."
"This is a very young but already fully enjoyable twist-top bottling from a unique site in the rugged mountains north of the Santa Maria Valley. Fresh aromas of blackberry and black currant meet with rosemary and tarragon on the nose while the easy-to-quaff palate shows flavors of freshly plucked boysenberries, oregano and marjoram. The high alcohol is completely hidden."
"Aromas of French oak, exotic spice and black-skinned berry take center stage. Fresh and linear, the palate offers cassis, cranberry and crushed raspberry framed in fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink through 2023."
"Swirls of orange blossom and vanilla introduce this richly textured Roussanne. Soft, honeyed flavors of tangerine and pear are broad and expansive on the palate, accented by hints of earth and sunny lemon acidity. Drink now through 2021."
"Leathery berry aromas are dense and earthy, while not showing any of the green character that sometimes plagues Carmenre. A flush mouthfeel is solid and fruity, with berry and plum flavors that are roasted and meaty. Savory notes on the finish suggest a pairing with barbecue."
"A bright bouquet of red currants, strawberries, back pepper, olives and medicinal bitters show this Pinot to be approachable when young, particularly by Martinborough standards. The palate is silky, savory, earthy and red-fruited, finishing salty yet refreshing."

"The richness of Grenache is offset elegantly with Syrah's edgy, peppery finesse in this elegant blend. Black cherry and strawberry preserves are plump and ripe but balanced neatly with zesty acidity and bristling undertones of savory herb and chalky tannins."
"Lanci is one of the villages of Beaujolais-Villages, next door to Morgon and sometimes seeing itself as a Beaujolais cru in waiting. This wine certainly has structure and aging potential along with plenty of red fruits and acidity. These elements suggest that the wine will be ready to drink from late 2018."
"Aged in large wooden 158- and 800-gallon barrels, this wine is rich with spice and toast flavors over the soft tannins. It has great black-fruit flavors, acidity to balance and a ripe aftertaste. The wine is smooth and can be enjoyed now but will be better from mid-2018."
"Underbrush, new leather, game, pipe tobacco and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, a hint of mint and the same gamy note as the nose alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Aromas of dark culinary spice, mature berry and a whiff of new leather emerge in the glass. The tightly wound, tense palate offers wild cherry, licorice and clove framed in taut, fine-grained tannins. Give this another year or two at least to fully develop. Drink 20192025."
"This is a surprisingly bright and herbal Pinotage, with an intense fynbos streak to the bouquet and a distinct, almost mentholated character that lifts the ripe plum, cherry and berry fruit. Framing tannins lend structure to the medium-weight palate, while notes of lightly charred black fruit and espresso unfold on the spicy close."
A shy nose belies a simplicity of green apple and fennel in this full-bodied fleshy wine that satisfies in freshness and complexity. Toasted oak marks the lengthy finish.

"Crisp and dry, this light-bodied wine has vivid acidity and fresh Bosc pear and white peach flavors along with a lightly astringent texture that's very appetizing. It will be just the thing as an apritif with toasted almonds and olives. Blended from Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Picpoul and Viognier."
"Violet, black-skinned berry and vanilla scents are front and center while the concentrated, polished palate doles out juicy red cherry, cinnamon, mocha and a drop of vanilla. Fine-grained tannins provide the lithe framework. Enjoy through 2025."
"This soft-textured, mouth-filling wine has woodsy, fallen leaf aromas, gentle flavors that combine savory and fruity accents and mild acidity and tannins. It's medium to full-bodied and soothing to sip."

"This blend of Carmenre, Syrah, Cab Sauvignon and Petit Verdot smells of forced oak and mint on top of standard berry scents. The palate is full and oaky but not heavy. Ripe yet racy flavors of jammy berry fruits are woody on a finish that's tannic and rubbing."

Rich and full on the palate yet balanced firmly with tannins and acidity, it's a stately wine with a lingering, slightly astringent chestnut finish."
"From a vineyard recently replanted and coming into its own, this offers dusty weavings of tobacco, clove, tar and leather, as burly and brawny as a humidor. Big-boned and ripe, the tannins are seamless on the palate and soft on the finish."
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of underbrush, cedar and black-skinned berry. The chewy palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, black pepper and coffee alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now through 2024."
"Bolstered by a splash of co-fermented Syrah, this wine's soft and inviting nose shows black cherries, smoke, bay leaf and crushed rose petals. This bottling contains more hickory smoke seasoning than past vintages, which surrounded the red cherry and purple flower flavors. It's a great pairing for a barbecue."

"Immediately appealing on the nose, this reserve offers a wealth of aromas in brandied cherry, anise, clove and savory dried meat tones.

"This is a great change-of-pace wine, rather full in body and rich in texture, but with zesty grapefruit and rose petal aromas and buttery almond-like flavors that are more savory than simply fruity. As if Italian native Fiano wasn't a rare enough grape variety, the winemaker blended in 15% of Coda di Volpe, an even lesser known Italian variety."
"This wine's fresh, bright and zesty lime and green pear scents have a lovely touch of nettle. The palate has the sprightly ease of these fresh flavors but also a lovely, grounding element of yeast that adds texture."
This wine is nicely balanced considering how big it is in terms of tannin and body. The aromas ooze blueberry syrup and blackberry jam while the flavors are equally rich. The texture is quite firm and tannic but it feels right and will help the wine age well. Best after 2022.
"A touch of smoky, spicy oak flavor gives this ripe and berry-soaked wine a nice twist of complexity. It has strawberry and boysenberry aromas, and full, almost jammy, flavors riding on a smooth texture that shows soft tannins."
"Lifted aromas of lemon and grapefruit combine with toasted nuts, green flower stems and a salty, sea spray quality. The acidity in this wine at the moment is searing and texturally it's a little lean and mean, but this fum-style Sauvignon should be an interesting one to watch develop in bottle over the next few years."
"Coming from a site in the Rocks District, this wine is lighter in color and brings initially subdued aromas of cassis, herb, medicine cabinet, plum, cherry and spice. The palate is soft in feel, putting a premium on elegance of expression, with the tannins quite supple. It's a very pretty expression of the variety."
"Listed at a low alcohol level for a hot vintage and vineyard, this is still and 100% varietal. Its black licorice, sugared plum and exotic spice aromas show a penetrating purity. The palate is all about delicacy and elegance, which it brings in abundance. It's a very pretty expression of this variety, maybe too much so for some tastes, without the variety's typical tannic heft. But for those looking for a sophisticated style of Cabernet, look no further."
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of cooking spice, leather and a whiff of violet. The firm palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove and licorice set against closed-grained tannins. Drink through 2025."
"Black olive, truffle and a nuanced streak of graphite shine in this softly textured, focused and well-made wine. Cedar and dried herb complement quietly in the background, as integrated oak supports without distraction."
"To the eye, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is light, with some rustiness. An earthy nose is funky and reduced at first, then more clear. A reduced palate with gritty tannins shows flavors of cooked berries, raisin and fig. Those same very ripe flavors persist on a warm finish."
"Nice depth and breadth come together in this richly packed, fruity and full-bodied wine. There's a hint of freshly baked bread in the aroma along with ripe plum and blackberry, while an almost jammy richness spreads across the palate and lingers on the finish."
"A flinty note of reduction hovers above the ripe, fleshy aromas of red and black cherries. The palate drives home the ripe and abundant cherry fruit on a concentrated, ripe but still fresh palate. The finish has ample fruit but also levity."
"Very light in the glass, this twist-top bottling offers tight and bright aromas of white rose petals, citrus peel and cold steel on the nose. The palate is much more exciting, with lime zest, baked nectarine, lemongrass and a hint of marshmallow, all set against a chalky structure."
"Licorice, olive, cherry cough drop and cassis aromas lay the framework for a flush chewy wine that includes descending amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Toasty flavors of blackberry, coffee and mocha are peppery, spicy and dry on a solid finish. Drink through 2022."
"High-toned red fruit is complemented by citrus-squeezed vibrancy in this full-bodied red, that presents as fleshy on the palate. A grit of oak adds power to the lengthy spicy finish."
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Colorino, this has aromas suggesting cassis, leather and a touch of cedar. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, clove and tobacco set against fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2025."
"Aromas of black-skinned berry, mint and cooking spice abound on this 90% Sangiovese and 10% Colorino blend. The medium-bodied, juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and clove alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2022."
"Red-skinned berry, dark spice and balsamic aromas are front and center on this structured red. The firm, savory palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and grilled herb alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2024."
"Gripping in texture and nicely saturated with ripe plum and smoked meat flavors, this is a compelling, interesting and complex wine. It shows light oaky, toasted accents on top of vivid red cherry and black-cherry flavors, while firm tannins and good acidity keep it appetizing."
"Dark but friendly fruit flavors seem to saturate this medium-bodied wine, showing admirable concentration on the palate and good length on the aftertaste. Blueberry, boysenberry and mild spices give it lots to like. The wine is 100% varietal and has a firm texture without obvious tannins."
"A bit lighter in color than the typical Syrah, this wine, which comes in a squat wide bottle, shows strawberry, roasted fennel and a savory smoke quality on the nose. There's a bountiful burst of acidity at the tip of the sip, followed by a spice rack of flavors that give depth to the light, slightly sour red-currant fruit. It's very tangy on the finish."
"French oak, espresso, toast, coconut, underbrush and spiced plum aromas carry over to the assertive palate along with cranberry, star anise and dried sage. Flexed, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provide firm support."
"This wine comes from a number of top sites, including Bacchus, Champoux, Loess and Seven Hills. Pleasing aromas of graphite, spice, fresh herb, whole green pepper and earth lead to light fresh-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It shows a lovely sense of balance. This was a cool, particularly challenging vintage for the state but this wine succeeds on many levels."
"Underbrush, cassis and star anise aroma follow over to the firm palate together with dried Morello cherry, espresso, powdered sage and a hint of tobacco. Tightly stretched, close-grained tannins leave an assertive, slightly astringent finish. Give the tannins a few years to unclench then drink up."
"Heavy oak makes for a rooty-smelling wine with aromas of clove and Old Spice fragrance. A firm drying palate delivers an intense oaky attack, while this tastes of forest berries, clove and wood spice. A powerful finish ensures that this will last a while. Drink through 2024."
"Mature black-skinned berry, exotic spice, baked plum and menthol aromas lead the nose while the ripe palate offers dried black cherry, prune, clove, toast and a hint of dried sage. Close-grained tannins provide firm support while a blast of orange zest brightens the finish."
"Vibrant blackberry aromas leap from the glass on this bottling, which also offers anise, violet and dried meat aromas. The palate combines smashed black currants with black pepper and violets, wrapped together by serious tannins."
"While plush with ripe blueberry and cherry flavors, this full-bodied, warming red has tinges of freshly tilled earth, garrigue and spice. It's not concentrated but easy drinking and fresh. The finish is moderately long, ending in slightly tacky but fine-grained tannins."
"The name of this cuve refers to the natural yeast used in fermentation. Bottled without added sulfur, the wine is soft with a direct line of juicy acidity. It is a complex, structured wine with some firm tannins. Drink this wine from 2019."

"This bright purple wine, still very young, is sold to raise funds for a local hospital. It is rich and packed with firm tannins as well as succulent black fruit. This powerful wine needs to age further, so drink from 2019."
"Almost as pale as water in color, this is a fascinating wine. It starts with aromas of sweet peach blossom, candied tangerine rinds, honeysuckle and white rocks. There is a flash of sweetness on the zippy palate, but it quickly dissipates into a floral Asian pear-laced flavor profile. It is a perfect pairing for sushi."
Oak aging has given this otherwise intensely fruity wine extra richness. It adds spice to the red-berry fruits and bright acidity. Concentration from the 65-year-old vines intensifies tannin and enhances the fruitiness of this wine. Drink from late 2018.
"Waxy lemon peels and dusty mineral notes lend a savory feel to this medium-bodied white. Red apple and pear notes are more muted than fresh, but highlighted by fresh lemon acidity and lingering salinity on the finish."
"This is a delicious wine, full of structured fruit. Acidity and bright cherry flavors are given shape and density by the concentration of old vines and the dry core of tannin. Drink this balanced wine now."

"This is a meaty, brawny wine that's well-conceived and velvety smooth in texture. It ticks all the boxes on the variety, imparting well-defined layers of leather, black pepper, blackberry and gunpowder, lasting long on the finish in a trickle of spice."
"Brawny and vibrant in acidity, this well-made full-bodied wine is a study in softened tannin and texture, with an oomph of weight and breadth. Raspberry and black cherry shine alongside black pepper and cinnamon with a lasting tease of brick and leather."
"Pristine blackberry and raspberry are flecked with spice and earth in this plump yet freshly composed wine. A hint of rubber accentuates earthy, savory tones on the midpalate but these turn to prettier dried herb and lavender on the finish."
"This wine is rich and ripe with red fruits. Its structure and dry tannins suggest a wine that will age. Red berries, acidity and a dry core point to a well-structured wine to drink from mid-2018."
"Brawny, this is an inviting version of the variety, well-done by this historic producer. Baked plum is met by dusty, soft and rounded tannin structure, the oak supportive and happy in the background. The light spiciness adds a sense of richness. This is an ideal pizza wine."
"Firm and with a dry core, this wine has great concentration and rich tannins. Ripe fruit lies under this solid exterior, waiting to come through in the coming months. The wine will show great richness as it matures. Drink from 2019."
"Concentrated black cherry and black olive aromas have an earthy edge in this full-bodied wine, while the flavors are dry and potent black fruits with touches of dark chocolate. It's a well-structured wine that will improve through at least 2021."
"Blue flower, baked plum and pipe tobacco aromas slowly take shape. The palate offers dried cherry, prune, star anise and crushed sage while firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins provide the austere backbone. Give this a few more years for the tannins to unwind. Drink 20192025."

"The vineyards on the steep hill leading down from the chapel of La Madone have given a structured wine. Weight and richness underly firm tannins. Concentrated and potentially full of fruit, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"Heady aromas of rose and jasmine meld with rich tangerine and red apple notes. Off-dry on the palate, melon and florals meet with plenty of acidic cut from grapefruit zest, leading to a candied lemon and ginger finish. Weight, power and balance make this an excellent offering from winemaker August Diemel."
"Elegant and plush, this wine is both light and rich at the same time, as it combines a fine mousse of bubbles with good fruit and spice flavors and a creamy texture. Everything is well-blended and harmonious as well as concentrated enough to have a long and lightly ripe finish."

"A bold, bombastic, 100% varietal wine made from mountain fruit, this red was aged 30 months in all French oak, 52% of it new. It imparts burly notions of oak and tannin alongside graphite, cedar and sage highlights. Very ripe, it expands on the palate in blackberry and black pepper, never letting go of its power."
"Prickly, lightly herbal berry aromas are spicy, traditional and a touch rough. This is full in body but not overly packed with tannins. Flavors of herbal berry fruits and chocolate finish spicy, oaky and chocolaty, all of which are normal for a Colchagua red blend like this. Drink through 2023."
"Ripe smooth aromas of lightly herbal black fruits are foresty and chocolaty. In the mouth, this Shiraz blend is fleshy but also tannic. Baked flavors of spiced black fruits spread out on a finish that's more bulky than it is finessed."
Veins of waxy orange and lemon peels freshen this full-bodied but lively Viognier. Vanilla bean and tangerine flavors are rich and silky on the palate accented by fragrant swirls of honeysuckle. The finish is a tad warming but lingers pleasantly.
"Dark earthy rubbery aromas of spicy black fruits set up a saturated grabby palate with firm tannins. Spicy but ripe blackberry flavors finish with dark oaky flavors of coffee and toast. For a wine that's been in the bottle for over four years, this is in a comfortable state. Drink through 2020."

"The nose is limey and floral, with stone fruit and pea shoots at the core. It's the palate that keeps you coming back for more, with acidity that is in check rather than enamel-stripping, held up by a juicy, limey core."
"This unusual blend of Riesling, Chardonnay and Torontel smells much like a Moscato or Vermentino, with aromas of cured ham and lychee. Low acidity creates a fleshy palate, while flavors of lychee, honeydew melon and lime finish with green banana notes. Drink now; this probably will not age well."

"Scorched earth, underbrush, dark spice and grilled sage aromas are front and center along with a balsamic note. The firm palate reflects the heat of the vintage, showing dried cherry, clove and a hint of licorice alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink to catch the remaining fruit."
"Wonderfully expressive aromas of rose petals, litchis and yellow peach meet vivid, slightly sweet fruit-basket flavors in this rather full-bodied mouth-filling wine. It has great concentration and keeps the fruit notes humming through the finish."

The brawny, evolved palate offers coconut, oak-driven spice and steeped prune alongside the heat of evident alcohol and velvety tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture remaining fruit and freshness."
"Max Reserva Pinot Noir is one of those consistent performers: it's always very good, if not spectacular. This version is lean and earthy, with a good balance of acidity, dry red-fruit character and varietal correctness. Flavors of spiced tomato, red currant and herbs finish tight and raw."

"This is an unusual comingling of 40% Blaufrnkisch, 30% Syrah, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot. It compels in earthy tobacco and mushroom flavor, adorned in violet aroma. Soft and velvety, the fruit is compressed and tightly structured."
"This is a richer-leaning blend of 29% Viognier, 29% Marsanne, 29% Roussanne and 13% Grenache Blanc, with aromas of banana split, cognac-poached pears and a hint of caramel. Creamy flavors of baked pear, clove and vanilla are cut by a sharp Meyer lemon acidity."

"Aromas suggesting grilled sage, French oak, ground clove and a whiff of camphor come together on this. The tightly wound palate evokes raw sour cherry, coffee bean and anisette but not much fruit richness. Assertive, close-grained tannins leave a grippy finish."
"This value-driven wine is successful in its smooth texture and floral aromas, with minimal if any oak perceptible on the palate. Peach, apricot and melon mix for a fruity profile dipped in lingering acidity."

"Produced from organically grown grapes, this ripe, smoothly fruity wine has a light toast flavor from the wood aging. With its balance between citrus acidity and ripe yellow fruits, the wine is both rich and crisply textured. Drink now."
"The heat that dominated the 2012 Chilean vintage is evident in this blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. While the palate is lush, obtuse and dense, it also rings of tartaric acid, and thus the mouthfeel is not in full sync. Heavy oak along with brandied plum flavors are baked through the finish."
"Inky black in color, this is a rich beast of a wine destined for the cellar. At the moment, however, it's tight and not offering much, mostly just oak spice in the form of cola, pepper and dusting polish, along with some ripe red and black fruit. Drink 20192027."
"Quite reserved on the nose, this bottling from a vineyard seven miles behind Cambria, shows light berries and sweet wood on the nose. The palate combines dried berries with fennel fronds, but is still quite wound up and needs more time to emerge."

"This wine is traditional in style and fruity with light tannins and spice. Aromatic and crisp at the end, the wine is ready to drink."
"Dark shades of earth, sage and just a hint of rubber lend a rustic tone to restrained black plum and berry in this wine. It's savory yet elegant, offsetting a supple, mouthcoating palate with fresh acidity and hints of curry and cardamom spices. Baby-smooth tannins accentuate a soft finish."
"The aromas are bright and focused, with notes of lemon pith, candle wax and spice. The palate brings a mixture of peach and orange flavors. It provides a lot of appeal, especially at this price."

"This wine has some structure and tannic character, although the fruit dominates. Blackberry flavors are shot through with acidity supported by a dry core of tannins. The wine is still developing and will be better from mid-2018."
"This is a very pleasant, smooth and ripe-tasting wine that glides across the palate and spreads a jammy blackberry flavor to the corners of the mouth. It's soft in terms of acidity and tannins and has a sensation of sweetness from its ripeness."
"From one of the top climats or areas of Morgon, this wine is richly structured but has plenty of berry fruits laced with cherry acidity. It is ripe and certain to age further with the tannins that are still prominent. Drink from late 2018."
"This wine is fresh, crisp and offers blackberry fruit. It is light, softly tannic and juicy. Drink now."

"In the northern reaches of the country, just above Auckland, this winery is best known for its Burgundian style Chardonnays. Their 2015 Pinot certainly walks to its own beat. A mlange of orange peel, cumin, florals, meats, dried leaves and wet earth all swirl together. The palate is light to medium bodied, with flavors of earth, stones, and dusting polish. There's a slightly off-putting bitterness on the finish, but this is nevertheless charming in an old school kind of way."
"This dry wine has a vivid gold color and smells earthy at first, but it soon opens up to rich peanut and honey aromas, soothing almond and marzipan flavors and a mouth-clinging texture."

"Made from a blend of Saperavi and Sereksiya Charni, grapes indigenous to eastern Europe, this red is dense in aromas of coconut cream, sweet spice and brambly fruit. Medium-bodied, with a structured grip of tannins, the palate boasts plenty of crunchy red fruit flavors and sweet oak inflections. Searing acidity currently propels this along, yet with time this should mellow and integrate. Drink from 2020."
"Pomegranate and plum are complemented by dried herb in this brushy, moderately structured red wine. Thick dense layers of ripeness and oak give it a concentrated power highlighted in black licorice and black pepper."
This 100% varietal Cab has reserved aromas of blackberry Fruit Roll-Ups and barrel spice that lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors. It shows a fair amount of acidity considering the warmth of this vintage.
"Very ripe and saturated with dark fruit flavors, this full-bodied wine combines a jammy character with wisps of smoke and grilled herbs. It gets points for good fruit concentration and feels smooth and full on the palate."
"There's no mistaking the variety, with its perfumed aromas of rose petal, lychee and spice. It drinks a hair off dry and is broad in feel, gliding on the finish."
"From 60-year-old vines, this wine has some concentration even though its main thrust is fruity. Tannins underneath the red-cherry fruit and crisp acidity give a wine that is lightly structured and ready to drink."
"Combining both citrus pith and more tropical components, this bottling shows fresh melon, Key lime, light guava and a touch of passion fruit on the nose. It tightens up on the palate, with sour orange and lime-sprayed popcorn flavors."
"Big oak-based aromas are cheesy and feral. This has a full flush mouthfeel with tannic rub. Heavy spicy plum and berry flavors finish with raw scraping tannins. If an elegant, smooth Pinot is what you're after, keep looking."
"Very ripe fruit flavors like raisins and dried plums give this full-bodied wine a high concentration factor, while moderate tannins add more heft to the texture. It has a mouth-filling richness, high alcohol and a jammy character that lingers on the finish."

"Classic Zweigelt aromas of dark cherry, plum and white pepper show some nice depth on the nose. The medium-bodied palate brings a focused intensity of tart black fruit wrapped in a sheen of cedar, vanilla and peppery spice. Soft tannins and hi-def acidity keeps this alive and kicking, while a delicate cocoa-dusted, black-plum skin note closes this out."
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (45%), Cabernet Franc (30%) and Merlot. Baking spice, licorice, vanilla and dried fruit aromas are followed by full-bodied fruit and spice flavors. It brings appeal, but the fruit seems a bit desiccated. Tasted twice with consistent notes."
"This 100% Sangiovese offers aromas of underbrush, black-skinned berry and tilled soil. The straightforward palate offers blackberry jam, tobacco and mocha alongside closed-grained tannins. Drink through 2022."
"This blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah shows perky boysenberry, vanilla, crushed flowers and roasted black plum on the nose. Rounded red and purple fruits meet with leather and tannic tension on the sip."
"Light wood aging has enhanced the ripe fruit in this smooth, generous wine. Flavors of honey, almonds and citrus give both richness and minerality. Drink this wine now."
"Not shying away from oak influence, notes of crme brle, toasted nuts and some melon at the back lead into a rich palate that's nutty and salty, with some smokey oak characters. Opulent but not flashy, this is a full-bodied white that many will be grateful for."
"Fresh apples, pear flesh, squeezed lemon and spring blossoms show on the nose of this bottling by musician Zac Brown. There is a strong sizzle of acidity to the sip, where zesty flavors of Key lime spray and Pink Lady apples arise."
"Sour cherry, coconut, espresso and menthol aromas lead the nose. The palate is full-bodied but doesn't possess a lot of fruit richness, evoking raw cherry, orange zest, licorice and French oak. Taut, astringent tannins grip the finish."
"On the nose, this straddles the fence between citrusy and vegetal. A lean tangy palate plays up crisp minerality over chunkiness, while flavors of green herbs and cactus dominate through the finish."

"French oak, coconut and toasted aromas carry over to the tight, taut palate along with vanilla, dried sour cherry, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of roasted coffee bean. Grainy, astringent tannins give it a raspy finish."
"Oak, coconut and underbrush aromas mingle with espresso on this tightly tannic red. The grainy palate offers licorice, oak-driven spice and a hint of dried cherry but not much fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave an astringent, drying finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to catch the remaining fruit."
"Bright red-cherry and strawberry notes are offset by tones of dried herbs and underbrush. This wine is rounded and full on the palate but delicate in concentration. It finishes with drying, slightly tacky tannins."

"This fruity wine offers crisp lemon and juicy pear and quince flavors. This light, poised wine is ready to drink."

"Spicy cocoa aromas are followed on the palate by the crispest acidity and juicy red-berry flavors. Still young with its fruit character, the wine needs to broaden to bring out richness. Drink from late 2018."
"The winery's ode to its Italian roots, this blends Sangiovese with Malbec, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon, creating a hearty fruit-forward endeavor highlighted in cherry, berry, leather and chocolate. Pronounced oak provides a touch of bitterness that contrasts with the fruit."
"This wine is zippy and aromatic in tones of tropical fruit, grapefruit and a hint of bell pepper. The palate shows some weight from the rich fruit flavors, balanced by tingly acidity. It's capped off with a clean, mineral finish."
"Aromas of coffee and cocoa cream are in the fore of this ripe Cabernet Franc. Medium-bodied, yet light in concentration, the palate is carried by juicy cranberry, cherry and sweet oak flavors."
"Spicy prune, cooked berry and woodsy aromas open this blend of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. Despite showing a black color and coming from a very warm year, this shows a tartaric, bright side that's racy at best and a little out of balance at worst. Toasty blackened plum and blackberry flavors are spicy across an acid-driven finish."
"From several different parcels on the Cte du Py vineyard, this wine is both structured and fruity. Its crisp edge and dry tannic core both point to aging potential. Drink from late 2018."

"An intriguing combo of citrus rind, pear juice, coppery penny and toast aromas precede a palate that is rich but with balanced acidity and a toasty finish. A food friendly tipple."
"Savory aromas of roasted plum and berry fruits come with a hint of red-apple skins. This feels choppy and grabby, so don't expect a lush smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of raisin, prune and plum are heavy and a bit monotonous on the finish."
"Whole lime and white peach aromas are at the fore. As promised, it drinks dry with tart Granny Smith apple flavors that provide plenty of intrigue. Enjoy it with food to see it at its best."
"Aromas of plum cake, leather, menthol and a whiff of exotic spice slowly take shape. The palate is less expressive and needs time to come around, but eventually offers black cherry extract, star anise and a hint of tobacco. Dusty tannins lead to a drying, somewhat fleeting finish."
"The aromas are a bit unusual, with notes of wood spice and raspberry fruit leather, not seeming entirely harmonious. The palate is quite light in style, painting around the edges. It's interesting but it doesn't all come togethernot standing on its own."
"A hot 2017 with forest fires in many parts of Chile forced early picking, and seemingly this shear high-acid SB with just 12.3% alcohol was part of that. Spunky sharp flavors of briny citrus fruits include pyrazine-based notes of green herbs, while this ends with a high-acid finish."
"This is an oaky, smoky wine, with a full body and firm tannins. It smells like wood smoke and black pepper, tastes like smoked brisket and has an oaky sharpness in the texture."
"The warmth of the vintage shows through in this bottling, which typically exudes tension and focus. This is ripe in stone-fruit aromas and flavors, with shades of savory thyme. The weight of the alcohol is evident on the palate, giving way to a sightly flabby feel, yet a pleasing astringency of grape skins seems to balance everything out come the finish."
"This wine is fresh and fruity in flavor but serious in mouthfeel, as firm tannins and considerable acidity give it a lively, crisp sensation on the palate. It has tart red cherry and raspberry flavors and is very focused and pure tasting."
"Dense and full bodied, this wine offers lifted plum and black cherry notes, combined with spicy oak and cola. The tannins are on the chewy, leathery side but the fruit is rich and mouth-filling, with an interesting tangy orange-rind finish. A steak wine if there ever was one. Drink now2027."

"While this Cabernet Franc is showing its age in hoisin sauce and stewed-berry aromas and flavors, there's still a glimmer of freshness on the palate, with the tart cranberry keeping things lively.

"Light in color, this blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon shows berry fruit, baked brick minerality, rose petals and bay leaf on the nose. It's easygoing and unique on the palate, with tangy juniper, balsam oil and pine needle flavors spicing up the berry fruits. Butterscotch flashes on the finish."
"Warm woody aromas of oak, apple and barrel spice lead to a palate with low acidity and a resiny feel. A resiny oak flavor is up front, while on the finish this tastes of clove but not showing a lot of fruit or verve."

Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit."
"A ripe, fruity, red-cherry flavored wine, this is attractive already. It has a rich, smoky texture as well as layers of fruit and acidity. With the edge of tannin in the back, the wine could age further, although there is no real need. It's ready to drink now."
"While this is good, there are many disparate parts to this Pinot from southerly Malleco. The nose is strained, raw and a bit horsey, while this feels grabby and full on the palate, even creamy. Heavy oak and saucy plum and berry flavors turn chocolaty on the finish. At 15.5%, this is riper than most Chilean PN's."
"Gritty, earthy aromas of plum and cherry lead to a chunky oaky palate that's slightly abrasive and warm. A heavy oak character matches the wine's creamy plum and berry flavors, while a short oaky finish is limited. At 15.1% abv, this is not about finesse."
"Focused aromas of stone fruit, pressed apples and florals carry to a pithy, medium-bodied, off-dry palate, bolstered by ripe peach and tart apricot flavors. A mild vein of acidity keeps the weight in check and helps extend the blossomy, floral finish. For every bottle sold, 20% of the proceeds goes to organizations dedicated to pediatric cardiology."

The evolved, straightforward palate shows prune and a hint of clove framed in assertive, dusty tannins that leave a firm finish. Despite the tight tannins drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit."
"A crisp, attractively perfumed wine, this is packed with red-berry flavors and has a light tannic texture. It has a rich side although the attractive fresh acidity brings this wine to life. Drink now."
"Aromas of flower, peach and jasmine lead to spritzy, off-dry stone fruit flavors. Floral notes are threaded throughout the palate, with light ale notes on the finish that cause some distraction."
"Red berry, baking spice and blue flower aromas meld together on this. The bright, rather lean palate offers sour cherry, licorice and orange rind framed in vibrant acidity and taut but not very persistent tannins."
"Engaging aromas of spicy bramble berry and tilled earth start out strong, leading to a medium-bodied, red-fruit-driven palate supported by soft, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Cedar and pepper spice linger on the finish."
"A heavy blanket of oak dominates a nose with modest melon and apple notes, while this feels big, oaky and short on spine and zest. Previously mentioned heavy oak results in a creamy flavor profile, while wood is in the lead on a weighty finish. Drink now."
Fresh blossoms mingle amidst earth tones in this freshly composed blend of Grenache Blanc and Viognier. The spry palate offers crisp red-apple and citrus flavors kissed with honeysuckle. The finish is brisk but clean. Drink now through 2020.
"Subtle aromas evoking baking spice, baked plum and a hint of gunpowder emerge on this 85% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Canaiolo blend. The firm palate offers prune, clove and licorice alongside closed-grained tannins."

"There's a delightfully herbal edge to this wine, with wild strawberry, brambly raspberry and specks of pepper dotting the nose. The palate moves from tart strawberry to creamier, softer red fruit, all while maintaining a balanced zip of acidity."
"Aromas of vanilla, baking spice and plum are followed by ripe but quite light cherry flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency that seems at odds with the variety."
"The aromas are high toned, with notes of wood spice, dried herb and tire rubber, not seeming very varietal. The palate is ripe with plum and barrel flavors that paint around the edges. Mocha notes linger on the finish."
"The aromas are a bit unusual, with notes of red apple, overripe plum, spice and herb. The palate is lightly styled, with bunched-up cherry flavors that finish short."
"This is a plush and plummy Pinot full of florals, red and purple fruits, and some cinnamon stalkiness. It's bright and light-bodied, with a slightly savory finish. Chill down and slurp."
"Coming from the oldest Chenin plantings in the state, the aromas are light, with notes of sliced apple, flower and white peach. It drinks off dry, with sleek well-balanced honeyed-fruit flavors throughout. It's equal parts intrigue and delivery."
"Dense and full-bodied for an Otago Pinot, this wine shows notes of ripe red and black fruits, chocolate, cola, green herbs and a whiff of smoke. The palate is broody with chewy, savory tannins and an oaky finish."
"Furry berry aromas are a touch oxidized, and overall the nose on this Pinot lacks sizzle and freshness. A full-bodied palate shows little to no acidic lift. Given all that, it's not surprising that this tastes of chunky berry and plum, while hints of clove and wood spice appear on the finish."

"This shows earthy aromas of truffle, tilled soil and a whiff of ripe plum. The bright palate offers raspberry jam, cinnamon and a hint or orange peel alongside round tannins."

"Peach and passionfruit notes mingle with green bean and white pepper on the nose. The palate is lean with a good lick of acidity and a long, citrusy finish. Enjoy this thirst-quenching drop with a summer salad."
"Dark cherry aromas mix with notes of earth, coffee and coconut on the nose. Medium in weight, but with grippy tannins and bright acidity to offer support, the palate shows more levity in flavors of tart cherry and cranberry, bolstered by earth and bitter spice."
"This medium-bodied wine has a savory earthy style, starting with herb and chicken-stock aromas and leading to lemon and dried herb flavors. It has a good crisp balance that's appealing."
"Quiet aromas of citrus and stone fruit lead on the nose. A crunchy green apple flavor and quinine acidity keep the palate lean, taut and dry, racing to a mineral-dusted finish."
"A pleasant intensity of lemon-lime spray and ripe yellow apple carry the nose. Shocks of lime energize the initial sip, with an apple butter flavor pushing through. This wine was fermented and aged in neutral oak barrels, offering a bit of roundness to the palate."

"Attractive in floral and citrus notes, the oak is firmly in a supporting role on the nose, yet on the palate it takes the lead. Texturally, this wine is slippery and medium-weighted and slightly clunky in feel."
"Ripe yellow apple and shades of delicate florals dot the nose, leading to a mix of juicy tree fruits on the palate. A mild vein of acidity keeps this feeling fresh, making it a delicious, straightforward wine."
"A rich wine with tannins firmly in place, this is structured, with a dry core that contrasts with the juicy black fruits. A wine to age, it should not be drunk before late 2018."
"This wine is all about crisp red-cherry and berry fruits that burst from the glass. It is juicy, perfumed and bright. The dry texture underlines the fruitiness. Drink now."

"The aromas bring a touch of oxidation that distracts from the notes of cherry, cocoa, vanilla and spice. There are a lot of good things happening on the palate but they can't quite make up the difference."
"The aromas seem unsettled, with notes of vanilla, baking spice and dark fruit that don't seem entirely in harmony. The palate is chock-full of raspberry and barrel-spice flavors, with loads of coconut on the finish. The aromas and flavors seem out of sync."
"Lots of fresh dark-fruit flavor and a silky texture make this wine easy to sip and enjoy. Touches of spiciness and milk chocolate give it a sweet edge, and the tannins are soft on the palate."
The producer's entry-level Morgon shows many of the appellation's characteristics. Tannins and ripe fruit are all there as well as the balance with acidity and a solid texture. This fruity wine is ready to drink.
"Strawberry-jam aromas and ripe fruits give this wine a soft, smooth character. It has some tannins although these are incidental to the fruity thrust of the wine. Warm and ripe, it is ready to drink."
"On the lean and mean side, this wine shows green characters of broccoli, green beans and peas are followed by citrus, passionfruit, ginger and wet stone notes. The palate is searing in acidity but the fruit is well integrated, and the wet stone and white pepper finish is appealing."
"High-toned aromas of dark cherry and bramble berry lead to a palate of cedar, spice and dark plum. After 13 months in French and Hungarian oak, this wine is weighty and muscular."
"A wine that goes all out in the juicy, crisp stakes, this is bright with red-currant fruit and plenty of acidity. Old vines in this case means 50 years and there is some concentration as well as good fruitiness. Drink the wine now."
"Crisp and fruity, this wine is firm, with young tannins and juicy red-cherry flavors. Bright and packed with youthful fruitiness, it needs to be left for a few months. Drink from mid-2018."
"Subtle spice and earth notes accent core plum, currant and cocoa aromas. This is a full oaky style of Pinot with toasty plum and berry flavors that don't qualify as elegant. Mild heat and oak are players on a chocolaty finish."
"This blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Petit Verdot shows punchy aromas of strawberry, hibiscus and light licorice on the nose. The palate combines the red fruit with a pinch of mace and touch of savory herbs, with rising acidity toward the finish."
"Aromas of toasted oak, raspberry jam and tilled soil lead the nose. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and mocha accompanied by assertive, close-grained tannins. Drink through 2021."
"Punchy, reedy aromas of currant come with hints of leather and latex. This is a wiry wine with acidity as its main driver. Salty currant and plum flavors come with some buttery oak, while high residual acidity on the finish makes this shear on the back end."
"Apple and lemon aromas are in the fore of this wine, backed by vanilla oak tones. The palate finds a good balance of acidity and weight, but it's lacking the same appealing fruit offered on the nose. The oak sneaks in to dominate the finish."
"This wine is 100% varietal and was aged for 20 months in a mixture of American and European oak (40% new). The aromas are bright, with notes of assorted barrel spice, pickling spice, raspberry and dried herb. The palate is medium bodied with a bit of a hole in the middle. Bitters linger on the finish."
"Aromas of French oak, exotic spice, menthol and steeped prune come together. The monolithic palate is evolved, offering vanilla, espresso, dried black cherry and oak driven spice alongside seasoned, not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2021."
"This estate-grown wine shows lively notes of lemon-lime spray on the nose, with undertones of green apple and slate. Light bodied and medium-dry in style, riper notions of candied lemon peel and peach show nice intensity on the palate and linger on the medium-long finish."
"This is a well-behaved, nicely balanced wine with good cherry and sage flavors, an appetizing texture livened by light tannins and a touch of acidity. It should be versatile with food and easy to pour for a crowd."
"A blend of 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of bell pepper, black-skinned berry and baking spice. The straightforward palate shows red-currant jam, clove and licorice alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Full bodied and intensely ripe, this wine is expansive and juicy, with pronounced oak across the palate and fully sketched flavors of baked pear, apple and peach. The structure is moderate and the finish sweet in vanilla."
"This wine boasts an attractive combo of honeysuckle, green apple skins and white flowers notes while the palate offers balanced acidity with a citrusy, floral finish."
"This wine from one of the estates vinified by this cooperative comes from 50-year-old vines. Made from organic grapes, it's juicy, light and perfumed. Drink the wine now."
"This unctuous, ripe wine has a smooth and creamy texture. Its fruit is open, soft and lacks some definition and crispness. However the wine has weight and a juicy apple and pear aftertaste. Drink now."
"Lime zest, peach and floral notes precede a clean, zippy, slippery-textured palate. There's a nice weight to this wine, along with a long, peachy finish."
"This wine has plenty of tannins and a firm structure. The black fruits seem reticent and slow to come forward through the tannins. There is potential, but it will take time to release that juicy, fruity character. Drink from 2019."
"Merlot and Syrah both make up 39% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (13%), Cabernet Franc (7%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of vanilla, coconut, herb, cedar and cherry lead to lighter-styled fruit flavors, with blueberry notes on the finish. The tannins bright a slight grittiness, and the oak seems a little intense."
"A value-driven proposition that's been left unoaked, this wine is fully creamy and robust despite its lack of wood, shining in lemon and grapefruit flavor and a depth of texture. It finishes clean and crisp."
"This opens with aromas suggesting new leather, moist underbrush, blue flower and chopped herb. The straightforward, rather diluted palate offers sour cherry and a hint of star anise framed in loose knit, somewhat fleeting tannins."
"Notes of freshly roasted coffee and charred red berries pervade on the nose. Light in frame yet with a pleasing roundness, there's just enough support from tannins. Ripe red currant and tart cherry flavors are speckled by anise, with a green stem note on the finish."
Aromas of road tar and black cherry are medicinal. This has a raw grabby mouthfeel backed by generic flavors of roasted berry fruits. A benign finish is lightly herbal and shows a hint of brown-sugar sweetness.
"Stainless-steel fermented, with a small percentage of grapes from Lake County, this light-bodied white is bristling in acidity, highlighted in quince, lemon, melon and a shock of grass."
"This rich, medium-bodied wine offers notes of green beans and asparagus in a chili sauce. A buttery, nutty core leads to a slightly bitter, toasty finish."
"Off the bat, this cool-coast SB leans towards green via flat aromas of bell pepper and jalapeo. A chunky palate shows only moderate lift, while this tastes green and mildly bitter, like Casa Marin's Sauvignon Blancs often do. From a cloudy and rainy year with widespread ripeness issues, this is decent but incomplete."
"Typical of Casa Marin, this shows aromas that are more vegetal than fruity. On the palate, this offers good weight and balance, although the flavors run heavy on pyrazines, and thus taste distinctly green and bitter on a chunky finish."
"This is a very affordable, gentle, medium-bodied wine with good ripe-fruit flavors, hints of spice and a soft, plush texture. It's smooth to sip and has a welcome sense of ripeness along with low acidity."
"Aromas suggesting prune, vanilla and a hint of bell pepper lead the nose. The ripe palate offers raisin, black currant and licorice alongside dusty tannins. Drink through 2020."

This light and fruity wine has a crisp texture as well as plenty of acidity. These contrast with the red-currant and berry fruits that are juicy and succulent. Drink now.
"A pale, almost Provenal-colored wine, this is light and smoothly fruity. With a soft texture and caramel flavor as well as red fruits, this rounded, attractive wine is ready to drink."
"This has muted aromas of tilled soil, stewed prune and a whiff of game. The light-bodied palate is slightly more expressive, showing sour cherry and a hint of dark culinary spice set against loose tannins. Drink through 2018."
"Bright vibrant acidity persists in this vineyard-specific wine, made in a fleshy full-bodied style with plenty of toasted oak and gravelly, tannic texture."
"This is a very fruity wine in its ripe peach and apple flesh tones. The grainy texture isn't quite in balance with the searing acidity, but the appealing, ripe apple characters will please many drinkers."
"Oily apple and melon aromas are the opening, while this Chardonnay feels lean, lemony and a bit hollow. Citrus flavors are yeasty, soft and a touch bland, while this is solid on the finish but doesn't taste like much."
"Very ripe pear and peach aromas meet with coconut and white lily on the nose of this bottling. Lime, peach and yellow-melon flavors show on the slightly vinous sip."
"Bright, fruity tones of red cherry resound on the nose, leading to a softly structured palate that carries more bright red fruit alongside shots of granite and vanilla. Aged 10 months in Hungarian oak, this is a straightforward, pleasing Merlot."
"Lean, herbal currant aromas are lightly briny and prickly. A palate with moderate acidity and some creaminess feels good, while this tastes of spiced cherry and currant. A short finish doesn't expand or evolve."
"Made from young Chardonnay vines, this perfumed, elegant wine is crisp with acidity and ripe with red apple and spice. It is a soft wine, fruity and ready to drink."

"Aromas of toast, oak, cured meats and grilled herb follow over to the austere, astringent palate along with a hint of coconut and oak-driven spice. Lacking fruit richness, it can't stand up to the dominant oak sensations and grainy tannins."
"Aromas of toasted oak, menthol and scorched earth lead the nose while a whiff of plum stays in the background. The palate shows oak sensations including roasted coffee bean, toast as well as powdered sage and prune. Astringent, grainy tannins clamp down on the finish."
"A deep shade of mauve in the glass, this ros conveys much of its Syrah parentage, starting with aromas of rust, wet earth, dark plum and dewy herbs. Thyme and dark cherry fruit show on the palate, which is texturally sound although a somewhat odd expression overall. Might be better billed as simply a light Syrah."
"This offers subdued aromas evoking red berry and crushed mint that carry over to the somewhat dilute, simple palate along with a hint of star anise. It has firm acidity while dusty, rather fleeting tannins dry out the finish."
"Earthy mossy plum and berry aromas are herbal and saucy. This basic Carmenre feels plump and round, but soft. Herbal peppery notes accent generic berry flavors, while this feels heavy and a bit clunky on the finish."
This is a very pleasant well-proportioned wine that goes from ripe pear aromas to full expressive peach and pear flavors carried on a lush smooth texture. It's soft on the palate and low in acidity.
"Soapy berry aromas are tomatoey and not that stout. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenre, Malbec and Cab Franc feels wide and a bit flat. Raisiny berry flavors are slightly oxidized, while this is thick but quick on the finish."
"This wine from 40-year-old vines is packed with crisp red fruits. It has acidity, red-currant and red-cherry flavors and only the lightest tannin texture. It is ready to drink."

"Attractive dark-fruit flavors and a smooth texture lend a lot of appeal to this medium-bodied wine despite a reduced, earthy character in the aroma at first, which is not uncommon in screw-capped wines."
"This opens with fleeting aromas reminiscent of leather, dried herb and a whiff of dark spice. The no-frills palate offers hints of sour cherry and star anise alongside dusty, transient tannins."
"Reduced cherry aromas are basic, while this feels condensed and solid. Cherry and cassis flavors veer towards medicinal, while this easygoing Cab leaves spice notes on the finish after the fruit has faded."
"This wine come from the far south of the Beaujolais region, an area known as Pierre Dores (golden stones) from the color of the buildings. The wine tastes golden in its own way with flavors of yellow plums and light acidity to balance the generous texture. Drink the wine now."
"This fruity wine has plenty of crisp apple and light apricot flavors. It is tangy, zesty and has refreshing acidity. Simple and open, it is ready to drink."
"This bright, cherry-flavored wine is crisp, with a light texture and plenty of acidity. It is a classic juicy and fruity Beaujolais, ready to drink young."
"A delicate nose of strawberry, raspberry and cola leads to mild red-fruit and black pepper notes on the palate. Light in body, but silken in feel, the tannins are barely perceptible."
"Shy lemon melds with slate and pollen on the nose of this light-bodied wine. Initially citrus-driven on the palate, riper hints of tree fruits show midpalate, but are slightly flat from a soft vein of acidity."
"The aromas bring unusual notes of grape cough syrup, smoke, herb and cherry Jolly Rancher. The palate falls flat, painting around the edges."

"Baked cherry, pine forest and earthy compost combine in this medium-bodied lightly oaked wine from a vineyard planted to multiple clones of the variety. Native fermentation lets the fruit and spice speak quietly."

"Oaky and extroverted, this full-bodied wine smells lightly smoky and full of baking spices. The flavors resemble sweet cherries, strawberry jam and a touch of maple."
"Extremely fruity jammy aromas and flavors ride a soft juicy texture in this smooth easy-drinking wine. It's low in tannins and acidity, and has a sweet accent like maple syrup."
"Earthy mushroom and leather greet the nose and palate in this combination of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tannic, with a softer landing on the finish, it offers heightened flavors of plum and black cherry."
"With earthy aromas, this is a simple, soft wine. It has some black fruits as well as light tannins and an aftertaste with berry and spice flavors. Drink this open wine now."
"This wine is soft, with full cherry flavors and an attractive layer of dusty tannins. Ripe and packed with fruit, it's totally ready to drink now."
"Mild berry aromas are somewhat flat and rubbery. This medium-bodied Pinot is low on acidity and thus not that bright or vital on the palate. Woody, savory berry flavors are oaky on the finish."
"A boisterous smoky oaky streak dominates this full-bodied wine from the aromas of charred meat and maple syrup to flavors of blackberry syrup and smoked bacon. It's an extreme treatment that not everyone will love, but it stands out in a group of purely fruity wines."
"A little shy at first, lime leaf, lemon and peach aromas creep their way out of the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers a slippery texture and a lemony finish."
An obvious stamp of oak spices and butter defines this medium to full-bodied wine as it goes from butterscotch aromas to vanilla and eggnog flavors that have a sweet edge. The texture is smooth and rich.
"A dark color and heavy aromas of savory berry fruits, leather and animal are less than elegant. This is more soupy, sticky and ripe than most Itata Cinsaults. Candied red-fruit flavors finish on the hot side due to 14% abv."
"This wine is a blend of near equal parts Syrah and Sangiovese. Barrel notes are at the fore, with aromas of baking spice and vanilla far out front of the fruit. The palate brings easygoing plum flavors that are concentrated in the middle and light around the edges."
"Dried blueberries, thick blackberry jam and gingerbread aromas show on the nose of this older bottling from the Agua Dulce region. The palate is thick and tarry with flavors of charred beef and more blueberries. It's still alive, at least."
"Coming from Rosebud Vineyard, the aromas show a bit of oxidation along with a touch of volatility. It's a shame as the palate is full of luscious rich fruit flavors that provide a lot of enjoyment. Vanilla notes linger on the finish."
"High-toned cherry and cranberry aromas meld with shades of sweet spice on the nose. Round and juicy in feel, the palate brings a mild intensity of tart cherry and cranberry, with shots of cinnamon and vanilla. This is an easy-sipping, enjoyable red."
"Lemon, guava, ginger and baking spices lead into a zippy, citrusy and refreshing palate. This is an enjoyable, straightforward wine, perfect for easy sipping."
"Spry underripe peach, citrus spray and slightly bruised apple mark the nose of this new endeavor from Constellation. Off dry in style, the palate brings a bit more ripeness to the fruit, with a mild vein of acidity offering some lift."
"This wine is packed with ripe fruit with a texture giving just the right amount of tannin. The wine has weight, the result of the clay soil in which the vines grow. Tank aging has preserved the cherry flavors and crisp acidity. Drink now."
"This frothy wine is very fruity and lightly sweet, with a strong effervescence and pleasant apple and peach flavors. It tastes bright and lively, very fresh and straightforward."
"This medium-bodied wine has lots of fruitiness in the aromas and the flavors, showing golden apple and Bosc pear in the nose, and richer, almost-sweet yellow-peach flavors on the palate. It's on the soft side in terms of acidity, and has a plush texture."
"Powdery, yeasty white-fruit aromas are generic but pleasant. A fair palate weighs in on the plump side, while flavors of peach and melon are mild prior to a quick finish with surprisingly low acidity and not much kick."
"There's a green edge to the red berry and plum fruit core of this wine, with touches of fruitcake spice, violet and milk-chocolate brownie to sweeten the deal. It's medium in body, with fine and accessible tannins and a quick finish that ends clean."

"Aged for three months in barrel, this smooth, rounded ros is both fruity and rich. It has good acidity from the attractive red-currant fruit and an orange tang of zest at the end. Drink now."

Slightly sour cranberry fruit meets with dust and uncrushed peppercorn on the nose of this mostly Merlot bottling. The tangy red-plum-skin fruit shows on the sip too against a backbone laced in dried garden herbs.
"A very pale yellow in color, this bottling shows aromatic pear and lime juice on the broad yet sharp nose. The texture is a bit flat on the sip, and the peachy flavors are quite strong, with yellow pear in the midpalate and a slightly vinous touch on the finish."
"While this wine is all about fruit, it also has some concentration that gives it a full-bodied character that contrasts with the berry flavors and acidity. It is ready to drink."
"Petrol and wild herb notes mask cleaner aromas of citrus and apple on the nose. There's some nice weight to the palate, with bright acidity to match, yet the kerosene note continues to overpower ripe peach and apricot."
"This is a well-behaved wine that should please a crowd with its easygoing plummy flavors, smooth texture and soft acidity. It's medium-bodied and fresh-tasting."
"This wine has some structure, with an edge of dryness that highlights the ripe red fruits and acidity. A fruity wine from one of the top Burgundy producers, it is ready to drink now."
"Aromas of moist soil, new leather and a whiff of dark spice lead the way. The wiry palate is on the lean side, offering hints of sour cherry and dark spice alongside firm acidity and dusty, rather fleeting tannins. Racy acidity keeps it light on its feet. Drink now."
"This is basically Sauvignon Blanc, with 10% Carmenre added in for body. As a result, the nose is chunky and smells lightly of pumpkin and squash. A tangy palate is oily in feel, with green-fruit flavors. Popping acidity pushes a salty tasting finish."
"Wilting flowersgreen stems and allmeld with soft citrus on the nose. The rounded palate boasts plenty of ripe peach and melon, with loads of more florals dragging along. Mild acidity tries to keep up but ultimately dissipates on a green, geranium finish."
"A rich, slight boozy, nose of brandied cherry, cinnamon and bubble gum spice leads to a primary, ripe palate. Medium in weight, with soft tannins, its showy fruit lingers on the finish."
"Citrus and grassy aromas are just lively enough. The same can be said for the palate on this basic SB: it's a touch flabby and not blazing with acidity. Melon, citrus and generic green flavors finish quietly and without edginess. Drink immediately."
"Stewed berry aromas are a touch murky, while this feels dense, tannic and sticky. Stewed earthy plum and berry flavors come with a note of coffee grounds, while this is herbal and beefy on the finish."
"Ripe notes of peach and apricot meld with white flowers and freshly cut grass in this Riesling. There's a nice roundness to the palate, yet the melon and peach flavors lack intensity. Mild acidity leads to a short, yet clean, finish."
"A green, herbal streak weaves throughout the ripe plum and boysenberry character on the nose and mouth of this solid, straightforward wine. It's well balanced and easy to like, with soft tannins that frame the vibrant plum and cherry flavors, followed by a short yet clean finish."
"Predominately Cabernet Franc, this ros shows a good intensity of ripe strawberry and raspberry on the nose, with tart pomegranate kicking in on the palate. A well-placed balance of acidity keeps the fruit-filled palate in check, making this a perfect easy-sipping glass."
"A yellowish shade of pink in the glass, this bottling shows aromas of yellow peach and orange rind. Seared lemon rinds appears on the sip, alongside a touch of walnut in what is almost an oxidative style."
"Pas is known for rustic meaty aromas, and this wine, which also contains Moscatel, smells a lot like hot dogs before cooking. A mildly thick palate with floral cherry and raspberry flavors finishes with drying tannins and the taste of rose water."
"Stewed cherries, baking spice and cranberry-laced fruit-punch aromas show on the nose of this bottling. Cooked watermelon, plum jam and pomegranate reveal themselves on the plush palate, which lacks a bit of zip."
"Tight and lean, this has restrained aromas of moist forest floor, leather, espresso and balsamic notes. The firm palate offers dried cherry, steeped prune and oak-driven spice alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish."
"Yeasty vanilla aromas blend with notes of green melon and banana. In the mouth, this is chunky and round, with modest acidity. Yeasty flavors of green banana confirm that this is a mid-level wine."
"A bright pink color and unusually toasty spicy aromas are followed by bright raspberry flavors and a heavy layer of oaky spices, like cinnamon and ginger. It's a ros with attitude."
"Pomegranate and fennel frond aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate has cranberry and more pomegranate, with a crushed slate and gunmetal minerality."
"This opens with aromas of sun-baked soil, truffle, used leather and a whiff of overripe plum. The earthy aromas carry over to the no-frills palate along with dried cherry and a hint of ground pepper. Dusty, rather fleeting tannins give it an abrupt, astringent finish."
"This opens with aromas of blackberry jam, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak. The palate is tight and lean, offering prune, star anise and a slightly green note of powdered sage alongside astringent, grainy tannins that leave a dusty finish."
"Underbrush, tobacco and stewed prune aromas lead the nose. It's hard and lean in terms of fruit richness, offering raw sour cherry and clove alongside an acidic backbone and bracing, grainy tannins."
"Syrah and Merlot make up the majority of this blend, which is topped off with pinches of other Bordeaux and Rhne varieties. The aromas are inviting, with notes of blueberry pie, herb and smoke. The fruit flavors don't entirely deliver on this promise, with quite-light plum notes that paint around the edges. Vanilla notes linger on the finish."
"Fruity and flowery aromas of black cherry soda, dried strawberry and hibiscus show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is somewhat thin, with flavors of berry jam, anise and a pinch of thyme."
"This see-through Pinot with a rusty tint smells of tomato leaf, herbs and mixed spices, while fruit aromas are tertiary and not very ripe. A basic palate is low on energy, while this tastes of gritty plum and pepper. A slight bitterness extends onto a dry finish."
"Produced from 60-year-old vines, this crisp, juicy wine is bright with acidity and forward red-berry flavors. Light and fruity, it's ready to drink."
"While this wine has some of the tannic structure of Morgon, its juicy fruits and hints of banana give a much lighter character. Fruitiness drives this crisp wine and will allow it to be drunk from mid-2018."
"This has a subdued, fleeting nose showing cellar floor, weedy underbrush and used leather. The evolved palate offers mature cherry coffee and a hint of spice around loose, short-lived tannins."
"Punchy citrus aromas are within normal parameters for Leyda SB. A tight citric palate is loaded with pyrazines, causing citrus and lemon-lime flavors to come across as tangy and grassy. A finish with a texture of wet rocks is juicy but green in flavor."
"This blend of 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Zinfandel shows pepper, plump purple flowers, candied berries and Concord grape on the nose. There is piquant boysenberry fruit on the sip, as well as candied violets and lilacs, but the wine still tastes very young and needs more resolution."
"This single-estate wine is perfumed, lightly structured and full of ripe, juicy red fruits. With acidity and spice in equal measure, it is soft, packed with fruitiness and acidity, and ready to drink."
"Aromas of plum, baking spice and Band-Aid lead to a medium-bodied palate with a lightly tacky feel. The tannins bring a sense of astringency and it finishes bitter."
"Coming from one of the state's top vineyards and 100% varietal, this has aromas of cherry, cranberry, vanilla and freshly chopped wood which lead to tart cherry flavors that display a bitter note that distracts. Barrel aged for 20 months in 60% new French oak, the wood influence seems heavy, getting in the way of the finish."
"Smoky oak, savory aromas of cured meats and a dark extracted color introduce this blend from the Itata and Maule regions. A heavy tannic palate is rubbery and concentrated in feel, while gritty, roasted blackberry and black plum flavors are peppery and finish with scratchy drying tannins."
"Aromas of green herb, baking spice, nori, licorice and black cherry are followed by tart dark-fruit flavors that seem bunched up. It falls off on the finish, displaying a light medicinal note."
"Dark plum, mulberry, wet river stones and a touch of caramel show on the nose of this bottling. Candied pomegranate and baked red plum arise on the sip, with strong vanilla and baking spice flavors. The tannins are oddly both thin and chalky."
"Standard plum and berry aromas are clean and get the job done. This is clampy on the palate, with grapy dark-fruit flavors. Solid fruit character and firm tannins on the finish confirm that this is a good everyday Cabernet."
"Sourced from a vineyard on the bluff of Keuka Lake, this is ultraripe in expression, boasting a mix of stone and tropical fruit, blended with a spicy hop character. The palate is off dry in style, with a lush, slightly overblown feel, that leads to a mildly hot finish."
"Shades of spicy bramble and strawberry aromas blend with earthier, stemmy tones on the nose of this blend. Light in feel, but with a charming roundness, the palate pleases in boisterous red cherry and raspberry flavors, flecked by peppery spice."
"Waxy lemon, green beans, melon and wet stone show their faces, if shyly, in this Kiwi Pinot Gris. The palate is slippery in feel, with a tongue-tingling line of prickly acidity and citrus notes throughout."
"High-toned aromas of pencil lead, game, dark plum, fruit leather and green herb lead to plentiful dark-fruit flavors. The fruit seems a bit dried out."
Plum and berry aromas are solid and clean. This has a fresh snappy linear mouthfeel and plum flavors that hold up to scrutiny. Light notes of chocolate and toast lend some richness to the finish.
"Fresh cranberry and herbal spice aromas carry to the light- to medium-bodied palate, which boasts a bit of white pepper and violet flavors. Bright acidity and sandy tannins maintain the delicate frame. Drink now."
"The nose, with fiery red-fruit scents, includes a hint of latex. This feels full and slightly heavy on the palate, while lightly burnt berry and plum flavors end in blocky fashion, with a note of chocolate."
"This wine is pure juicy fruit. It bubbles with red cherries, acidity and a crisp shot of acidity. A refreshing, lightly structured wine, it is ready to drink."
"Opaque in color, this dense, rich wine feels nearly impenetrable. Hidden beneath the dusty oak and ripe blackberry flavors lie savory, herbal undertones. There's juicy black fruit on the palate and the tannins are drying but the fruit keeps things just supple enough to be approachable."
"Rubbery roasted aromas of burnt leaves and generic berry fruits are fine but not compelling. This Cab has a big jammy outlook. Candied flavors of berry fruits, oak and brown sugar convey ripeness, but the finish is low on acidity and weak on tannins, and thus this ends quietly."
"Currant, tomato and grassy scents bring ripeness into question. This feels solid but grabby, while slightly green and oaky flavors of medicinal red fruits carry over to a steady finish."
"A gritty nose smells of asphalt, which brings overall ripeness into question. A flat wide palate is resiny and oaky, while this tastes a bit burnt and green, with tarry berry flavors."
"Sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla dance over light fruit tones of cherry and strawberry on the nose. This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend shows a playful palate of spice, cherry and anise, with enough tension to keep you coming back for more."
"This is a very smooth, gentle wine, offering plenty of lush strawberry and cherry in the aroma and flavor while not going overboard in body. It feels supple and lightly sweet on the palate, and has very mild tannins."
"Grassy aromas are mildly citric and show cool, underripe notes of canned peas and beans. A citric bolt adds life to an otherwise fleshy palate, while this tastes of green grape skins, lime and asparagus prior to a slightly bitter finish."
"Cola spice, cherry stems and red plum lead the entry of this pleasant Syrah. The lightweight palate is easy and accessible, with juicy red-fruit tones that fill the palate. Hints of baking spice grace the close. Drink up."
Generous oak and tannin dominate around a sizable ripeness of cherry and vanilla in this youthful wine. Tart acidity accents the baked character of the fruit.
"New leather, camphor and dark spice aromas take shape on this. The wispy, light-bodied palate isn't as expressive, offering suggestions of tart cherry and ground brown spice alongside loose tannins and racy bright acidity. Drink now."
"Crushed asphalt and wet gravel meet with baked black cherry and a slight hint of herbs on the nose of this bottling. Though the acidity is balanced, the tannins are a bit clunky on the palate, where boysenberry, tar, cocoa and coffee flavors arise."
"After a few swirls of the glass, you'll detect aromas of fleshy black cherry, leather and culinary spice. On the lean, linear palate, you'll find sour cherry, orange zest and chopped sage set against brisk acidity and bracing, grainy tannins."
"A five-acre parcel of Chardonnay is the source of this soft, fruity wine. Wood aging has added extra richness as well as spice to the crisp apple and pear flavors. The wine is ready to drink."
"Brawny and rustic, this wine is sizable in tannin and oak, making for a big presence on the palate. Spicy clove is met by leathery tobacco and varietal aspects of cedar and dried herb."
"This single-vineyard Cabernet Franc has an interesting nose of dried beef and mesquite over a ripe cherry core. The soft, pillowy palate gives way to sweet vanilla and cherry flavors, balanced by a mild current of cranberry acidity. Oak dust marks the close."
"Rustic cherry, rhubarb and turned loam, along with a touch of fresh thyme, show on the nose of this fancifully labeled twist-top bottling. It's a bit thin on the palate, with sour red fruit, bay leaf and anise flavors."
"A one-acre parcel of young vines has given this bright, crisp wine. With its flavors of pear and touches of apricot it is both fruity and brightly textured. Drink this wine now."
"This wine pulls from all over Sonoma County to create a tannic, oaky and fruity combination of lush black cherry and cassis wrapped around vanilla and dried herb. Bold and brawny, it holds its ripeness in check."
"Standard aromas of celery, lime, gooseberry and minerals set up a palate that's not flat but is definitely low on snap and acidity. Lightly vegetal citrus flavors finish soft. Drink immediately."
"Wood smoke aromas and flavors give a spicy edge to this full-bodied, moderately tannic and perhaps slightly sweet wine. A toasted oak element is behind the smokiness, and it provides good counterpoint against the almost syrupy fruit flavors."
"Cut grass, wet cement and lemon wedge show on the slightly reductive nose of this bottling. The palate is sour and almost bitter with more cut grass and strong grapefruit-peel flavors."
"Mild fruit flavors and subtle spices give this medium-bodied wine a low profile. The aromas are vaguely appley and the flavors bring hints of vanilla, while soft acidity and a light buttery finish complete the picture."
"Quite aromatic and equally flavorful, this medium-bodied wine has a sense of sweetness from the strawberry and sandalwood aromas to the marinated cherry and maple syrup flavors. The texture is rounded and soft."
"Aromas reminiscent of weedy underbrush, overripe berry, roasted herb and a whiff of salted game lead the nose. The gamy note follows over to the evolved, rustic palate along with dried cherry, grilled sage, and clove alongside while close-grained fleeting tannins give it a loose framework. A salty note marks the close."
"Rustic leafy aromas are gritty and lean. This light-colored, lighter-bodied Pinot is racy up front, with a sticky note of animal fat on the back palate. Earthy, lightly oxidized flavors finish without elegance."
"Vegetables are in the fore of this wine, leading with notes of buttered green beans and mushroomsgrapefruit and lemon tones bring up the rear. The palate is rich and heavy but with searing acidity."
"Subdued aromas of underbrush, celery, truffle and a whiff of used leather set the tone. The aromas carry over to the dense, evolved palate along with dried blackberry, prune and evident alcohol. Raspy, fleeting tannins dry out the finish."
"Hailing from Antoine Creek Vineyard, the aromas of herb, cherry and spice seem to show some oxidation. Meanwhile, the medium-bodied cherry and raspberry flavors are straight down the fairway, providing enjoyment if not a lot of complexity."
"This opens with subdued aromas suggesting underbrush, camphor, oak and a whiff of cured meat. The palate is a bit muddled and rather diluted, offering hints of sour cherry, salt and espresso alongside dusty, somewhat fleeting tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish."
"A tropical fruit bowl of pineapple, mango and papaya carries intensity on the nose, with a little grass and white pepper in the background. The palate is less exuberant but it makes for an enjoyable sipper nonetheless."
"While oak-driven on the nose, boasting swathes of espresso bean and cocoa nibs, there's a core of ripe cherry and plum that carries the palate. A judicious balance of acid keeps this wine in check, while mild-grained tannins offer further support. A slight note of green stems arises on the midpalate through the astringent finish."
"Aromas of underbrush, prune, toast, used leather and a whiff of blue flower emerge in the glass. The short, simple palate offers black cherry and vanilla alongside dusty, somewhat fleeting tannins that leave a drying finish."
"Old vines with concentration and light tannins give this wine its intensely fruity character. It has a juicy, crisp edge along with good acidity and a bright aftertaste. Drink the wine now."
"Cherry and plum aromas include a note of green. This blend of Grenache, Carignan and Mourvdre is lean and choppy on the palate, with more acidity than body and fruit. Raw plum and cherry flavors finish gritty and underdeveloped."
"Slightly raisiny aromas form the opening. In the mouth, this is chewy and full, with abrasive tannins. Saucy flavors of plum, tomato and currant finish dry and woody, with a lasting note of clove that comes straight from the barrel."
"Candied, slightly broken raspberry aromas are mildly grassy. This Cab has rubbery tannins and a by-the-glass mouthfeel. Plum and tomato flavors are a bit salty, while this burns with spice notes on the finish."
"Whiffs of raspberry and cherry follow over to the extremely simple, light-bodied palate along with a hint of clove. Loose tannins offer relaxed support. Drink soon."
"Subtle stone fruit and delicate floral tones lead into a heavier-than-expected palate. There's a touch of residual sugar here amidst the fleshy stone fruit characters, with a brisk, short finish."
"Gamay makes an attractive ros, crisp and fruity. With red-currant and berry flavors, the wine is light, bright and lively. It demands to be drunk immediately."
"Extremely light on the nose, this wine eventually shows pleasant aromas of nectarine and orange peel. The palate is also inoffensive but mild, with poached apple and pear flavors, a touch of seared orange and the taste of a lemon juice on sweet squash."
"This attractively structured wine offers ripe cherry fruit and an edge of firm tannins. It's rich, full of fruit, smooth and ready to drink."
"This is a simple, fruity wine, crisp and bright with red cherries. Acidity and light texture make it immediately drinkable. It is a well-made, delicious wine."
"Classic Kiwi Sauvignon Blanc aromas of passionfruit, grapefruit and blossoms set the stage for a crisp, easy-going palate."
"Withered violet, dried sage and toast aromas lead the nose. The firm, fleeting palate offers dried cherry, orange zest and roasted coffee bean alongside dusty, astringent tannins."
"A pumped-up oak and spice character dominates this medium-bodied wine in terms of both aroma and flavor, so it sings a two-note song of nutmeg and vanilla. The texture is smooth and the finish seems sweet from the baking spice tones."
"An aroma of coffee puts a blanket over herbal bramble berry tones. There's a savory and almost sour note of tart fruit on the palate, with a thin feel and sharp acidity."
"This SB from the southerly outpost of Malleco smells briny and green, which given its cool origins is not a shock. A chunky palate holds vegetal flavors of peas, green onion, fennel and bell pepper, while a lean finish suggests nettle and milkweed."
"Aromas of coconut, toast, oak-driven spice and a whiff of prune lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the rather diluted, lean palate along with sour cherry and roasted coffee bean. Astringent, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt close."
"Aromas of plum and high-toned dried herb lead to cherry and berry flavors. The tannins bring a lightly gritty feel. The tartness of the acidity adds to the enjoyment, but you'd never peg it for Cabernet."
"Rough aromas of road tar and forced oak are most prominent on this Cabernet. A fully extracted palate is tough to process, while roasted blackberry flavors run heavy on the oak and clove. On the finish, a leftover clove flavor dominates."
"Scents of vanilla and sweet spice greet the nose upon entry, while raspberry sauce and brambly berry provide a solid grounding for the medium-weight palate. The tannins are soft and the acidity low, with a lingering mocha accent on the rich finish. Drink now."
"Black cherry and strawberry notes are a tad muted in this demure, full-bodied red. Soft acidity and tannins lend an approachable appeal but it's best to drink this wine young."
This wine is simple and fruity. Crisp black-cherry fruit is lifted by refreshing acidity while the light texture gives the wine an attractive tangy character. Drink now.
"This bright and crisp wine has red fruits, a touch of vanilla and lively acidity. It is a simple, fruity wine that is ready to drink."
"Subtle notes of tomato leaf, passionfruit and tropical fruit undertones are followed by a boney palate of tongue tingling acidity. Drink now."
"Very shy aromas of red berries and wet mud make for an earthy muddled nose. There is a flash of acid on the sip, followed by dust, more red fruit and a slightly woody spice."
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors grab the attention in this medium-bodied wine, while moderate tannins and rather soft acidity make it easy to sip."
"This wine tastes quite mature and savory and feels soft, showing some complexity of sun-baked fruit and earthy undertones."
"This soft, strawberry-jam-flavored wine is made from organically grown grapes. It has a pure fruity character just gently touched by tannins, presenting an almost sweet, ripe character. Drink now."
"This is one of the more odd-smelling Pinots you'll come across. Aromas of milk chocolate, cherry and mint are candied as a whole. In the mouth, however, this smacks with cool-climate acidity. Flavors of cherry, plum and oak-based chocolate finish with raw tannins."
"Leafy berry and cassis aromas are basic. This feels hard and choppy, with no sense of flow to the palate. Generic berry flavors finish chocolaty and a bit oaky."
"This straightforward and fruity wine is relatively light bodied, offering juicy black cherry and strawberry flavors and a hint of sweetness. It's soft and easy to sip."
"Pleasant notes of baked plum and black-cherry compote present an enticing bouquet to this wine. The palate is sharper and leaner in feel, with tart and slightly bitter fruit-skin flavors that finish clean but quick. Drink now."
"Very shy on the nose, this bottling offers dark red fruit and baking spice aromas with patience. The palate is flat and dull yet inoffensive, with flavors of sweet red fruit, herbs and char on the finish."
Assertive oak wraps around substantial richness and body weight in this highly ripe wine that lacks somewhat in structure. Tropical vanilla and coconut linger longest.
"From vines that surround the Fessy winery, this juicy, fruity wine also has a tang of tannins. Its acidity and crisp texture are immediately attractive and the wine is drinkable now."
"A note of kerosene dominates on the nose of this wine, which carries to a ripe, juicy palate of stone fruit. Medium dry in style, this is straightforward and easy drinking. Drink now."
"Soft and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine has a rose perfume, stewed plum, cherry syrup and nutmeg flavors. It is smooth on the palate, showing little acidity or tannin."
"The aromas display an uncomfortable mix of vanilla, dill and smoke, with the barrel influence taking over the show. The wood rides high on the palate as well, making it near impossible to get at the fruit."
"Other than that this is made from Pedro Ximnez and comes from a high-elevation vineyard in remote Elqui, there's almost nothing to this basic white table wine. Mild white-peach and yeasty aromas are followed by a bland palate. Lightly oxidized flavors of wheat and stone fruits are salty, while low acidity means the finish is soft."
"Wood-heavy aromas of bacon and clove don't allow for much fruit expression. This is tannic and weighty on the palate, with flavors of baked berry fruits, clove and burnt wood. Bacon and clove notes remain out front on a finish that's all about oak."
"The aromas bring bright notes of mandarin orange peel, honeysuckle and lime zest. It drinks off dry, with a lightly spritzy palate packed full of ripe peach flavors."
"Soupy berry and oak aromas lead to a thick dense palate. Highly herbal plum flavors are drenched in milk-chocolaty oak, while this is sluggish on the finish."
"Citrus and green apple take center stage in this medium-bodied Chardonnay. The palate has a mild intensity of these flavors, with soft acidity offering some structure."
"Aromas of toasted oak, pressed violet, roasted coffee bean and ground pepper carry over to the wiry palate along with raisin and powdered sage. It lacks fruit richness while grainy tannins leave a raspy finish."
"Toasted oak and a huge concentration of tannin dominate in this burly, full-bodied and highly ripe wine, which finishes in a bittersweet and sour taste of leather."
"There's a chemical quality to this wine that doesn't seem to blow away. Dusting polish, smoked meats and berries lead into a tightly wound palate of tart red fruit and more polish, with chunky tannins and apparent oak."
"Reticent aromas of citrus, green apple and crushed stone carry to a light-bodied, quince-driven palate, with a metallic edge. Spritzy in feel, this is simplistic but enjoyable."
"Funky aromas of scorched soil, withered rose, used leather, stewed prune and a hint of barnyard follow over to the overripe palate along with licorice and a gamy note. Dusty, evolved tannins offset the earthy flavors."
"This has a shy nose that eventually reveals moist underbrush, oak and a whiff of salted meat. The palate is somewhat diluted, presenting suggestions of dried black cherry, fennel and toasted oak alongside fleeting but drying tannins."
Jammy berry aromas are herbal like desert brush. This is a pulpy wine with a jammy palate. Earthy stewy berry flavors are green and oaky on the finish.
"Crisp and fruity, this light, bright wine has strawberry and red-currant flavors as well as a lively background of acidity. It is totally ready to drink."
"Fermented with natural yeast, this light wine is crisp with red fruits and acidity. It is a delicate wine, bright and ready to drink."
"Aromas of stewed prune and wet underbrush follow over to the evolved palate together with a hint of dried cranberry and clove. Dusty, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish."
"This is a light wine, just juicy red cherries and bright acidity. The structure is also light, leaving fruitiness and immediate drinkability as the wine's main characteristics. Drink now."
"Medium-bodied and pleasant to sip, this unassuming wine has subtle plum flavors and a smooth texture. The mouthfeel is soft and the finish is short."
"Coconut, French oak, vanilla and dried sage aromas follow through to the austere, assertive palate alongside firm acidity. Unyielding, close-grained tannins give it an astringent, lean finish. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Antoine Creek and Gingko Forest vineyards. Quite light in color, the aromas show a light volatility, along with notes of raspberry, strawberry and maraschino cherry. The fruit flavors are light, simple and sweet, finishing with peppermint notes."
"Neutral aromas lack pungency and instead are yeasty and suggestive of green pepper and mild citrus fruits. A round palate lacks the pop and zest that Chilean SB often shows, while this tastes of grassy melon and white pepper prior to a flat finish."
"From a new urban winery located in the heart of Geneva, NY, this Riesling shows toast, smoke and slate notes over a core of citrus on the nose. Round in feel, with a good balance of acidity, the palate shows more fruitpeach and lemon curdthat carries to a crisp, clean finish."
"Citrus spray and delicate peach aromas are behind a thin veil of pollen and yeast tones on the nose. The light-bodied palate shows a bit more clarity in its cleaner citrus and stone-fruit flavors, yet ultimately this is a straightforward and accessible semidry Riesling."
"This unoaked Chardonnay has a mild intensity of underripe peach and citrus on the nose, with a muddling of white flowers. The palate lags a bit with soft acidity, yet ripe peach chugs along to the finish."
"Slightly weak aromas of pomegranate-laced fruit punch, herbs and dust show on the nose of this bottling. Strawberry and fennel flavors are evident on the palate."
"Soapy citrus and cantaloupe aromas are rather bland. This is quite high in acidity, while the wine's lean body struggles to support that raciness. Mild stone-fruit and citrus flavors are lightly bitter on a tangy finish."
"Soft although with a crisp edge, this wine offers flavors of red cherry and red currant. Plenty of acidity gives the wine its fresh character. It has a tangy, lightly tannic aftertaste."
"Bright, brisk and fruity, this is a light wine. Soft tannins contrast attractively with the red-cherry juiciness. Drink now."
"Largely neutral white-fruit aromas include a hint of citrus. On the palate, this SB feels a bit flat and fleshy, with mild acidity. Standard apple and orange flavors are salty across a basic finish."
"With a straw-gold hue, this is a creamy, full-bodied wine, with an unusual medley of asparagus, tomato stalk, ginger and lemon notes. On the palate, the acidity is nicely balanced but the style is rather brash and odd."
"Hickory-cured meat, sweet smoke, mocha, raspberry compote and berry preserves all dance on the nose of this decadent value wine. The palate offers similar concentration, with fine tannins and a strong dose of blackberry-laced coffee on the close. Drink now."
"A raw nose with green-herb and bell pepper aromas offers just enough cohesion and fruit to be decent. In the mouth, this is wiry and racy on first impression, then soft. Leafy herbal berry and prune flavors culminate on a vacuous finish."
"This extremely dark and concentrated wine has aromas like smoked ham plus peppery smoky flavors that push the limit of style, along with very obvious tannins that leave a drying impression on the palate."
"If you're looking for a basic white quaffing wine that's priced to sell but won't wow, this is it. Oily aromas of almond skins come with hints of apple and pear. Modest acidity and nutty, yeasty flavors of salt and bitter melon finish with signs of early oxidation."
"A very light nose conveys purple fruit, dried herbs and a bit of bell pepper on the nose of this bottling. Pasilla chile shows on the sip alongside boysenberry, thyme and wood spice."
"As simple and fruity as a Beaujolais can be, this is light, bright and full of red cherries. Acidity and tangy texture make the wine totally drinkable now."
"Melony vanilla aromas are flat, while this mature SB feels plump and fleshy, but distant. Wheaty bland flavors of white melon lack pop and vitality, while this tastes and feels bready on a tired finish."
"A neutral nose shows a hint of citrus but that's it. This feels more plump and flabby than well cut, but it's not outright flat. Chunky melony citrus flavors end with low acidity. Drink this value-priced quaffer with caution."
"A definitive green nose smells just short of vegetal, while a round, plump palate with good acidity is a high point for this Elqui SB. A vegetal flavor of canned beans doesn't shed the wine's core green character."
"Lightly volatile aromas of baking spice, black licorice, cherry and vanilla lead to sweet, pruney fruit and barrel flavors, with the barrel notes riding high on the finish. It seems quite evolved for its age."
"A rusty color and lean, almost grassy aromas set up a tannic but solid palate. Consistency of fruit flavor is lacking as this tastes like leafy plum and pepper prior to a slightly oxidized finish."
"Stalky wheaty aromas register as underripe. This Chardonnay feels bland and thin, with yeasty melon flavors that finish without much flavor. Tasted twice with similar findings."
"Subdued on the nose, slight indications of ripe peach and pollen carry to a citrus-driven palate. This is light in intensity and complexity, with a sweet-tart notion on the finish."
"This starts off somewhat shy and closed, with muted notes of tight black-plum skin, tree bark and black olive. The medium-weight mouth offers a bit more character, with waves of roasted plum and blackberry that finish with a slightly bitter, charred oak edge. Drink now."
"Berry fruit aromas are slightly damp and oaky. This feels choppy and chunky, with wiry acidity. Oak and herbal plum flavors finish simply, with a leftover smear of artificial oak."
"A true-grit nose smells like you're trailing a road crew laying down asphalt. The palate is rather chunky and beefy, with grilled flavors of meat, pepper and burnt leaves. Fresh fruit is just not part of the package, and that's a problem."
"Waxy white-fruit aromas are mild and simple. On the palate, this blend of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Viognier is wide, oily and grainy in feel. Savory salty green melon and banana flavors are lightly oxidized on the finish."
"Pale watermelon in color, this wine is straight to the point with its melon and raspberry tones against a slight green herb backdrop. The fresh fruit note turns a bit sour on the finish."
"Rusty in color, with tomato, herb and raw-currant aromas, this is shear on the palate and raging with acidity. Flavors of hard spices, lamb fat and herbal red plum just make it to the level of good, while this is tangy and sharp on the finish."
"Built to be simple and cheery, at a solid price point, this wine is indeed simple and soft, with flavors of charred oak, soy, black cherry and an intensely herbaceous character."
"Oily, slightly vegetal aromas are lacking in pop and purity. On the palate, this is similar to the nose: flat with no cut or angles. A mix of grass and melon flavors finishes mildly bitter."
"Named after the village in which the producer has its winery, this wine is all fruit. Red berries and hints of banana give a wine that is crisp, laced with acidity and ready to drink."
"Aged 11 months in used French oak, this wine is citrus driven, with a slight toasty edge. The mild acidity carries short flavors, making this a simple pour."
"This value wine has an astringency that adds to an overall puckering notion of ripeness and oak. Earthy mushroom and compost underlie red fruit, yeast and cedar."
"Earthy notes of carnation, cured game and green peppercorn are pronounced in the bouquet of this wine, with supporting red plum and cherry fruit. The medium-weight palate boasts astringent tannins and fruit-skin flavors that prevail through the grippy close. Drink now."
"Aromas of licorice, prune and leather try hard to hold up but fade to herbal and soupy. High tartaric acidity throws the palate out of balance, while this tastes of generic plum and prune. A short chewy finish closes this out."
"Earthy cranberry and an herbaceous underbelly ride along this somewhat thin yet ripe wine, which finishes in a bitter twinge of cardamom and oak."
"Roasted leafy earthy aromas are less than focused and not entirely fresh. A wide palate is dull-edged, while this tastes woody, earthy and a bit musty, without vivid fruit. Oak-based clove notes ride high on an otherwise bland finish."
"A neutral, nearly scentless nose sets up a palate with modest acidity but nothing more. Short citrus flavors see oxidized notes poke through on the finish, indicating that this basic wine from a wet vintage is passing its prime."
"A three-acre vineyard of 55-year-old vines has produced this bright, crisply fruity wine. It is juicy with considerable acidity as well as plenty of red-cherry flavors. Drink now."
"Lifted aromas of ginger, florals and ripe citrus are somewhat enticing, but the palate is acidic to the point of sourness, with an odd combo of spritz and fruit weight."
"A very strong and spicy oak aroma leaps from the glass, and the same dramatic smoke and chocolate element dominates the flavors of this full-bodied wine to the point that any fruity aspects are very muted."
"Streamlined aromas of citrus, florals and crisp apples on the nose lead to a richer impression of melon and orange on the palate. Mild acidity and little concentration of flavors make for a simple, straightforward pour."
"Apple cider and white-flower aromas are more briny than fresh and perky. This feels plump and oily due to moderate acidity, while salty white-fruit flavors are chunky on a mostly fruitless finish."
"A yeasty but light nose with nothing more than a whiff of lime sets up a racy citric palate that's shearing and angular. Tart apple, underripe nectarine and lemon-lime flavors finish long but sharp almost to the point of being sour."
"Barnyard aromas and massive, drying tannins really stand out in this unusually raw-boned wine. It smells earthy and smoky, tastes meaty and herbaceous, while the texture is full of potent, gripping astringency on first sip that eventually moderates with subsequent tastes."
Simple fruit and a light texture make for a crisp wine. Red fruits and acidity balance with the light caramel texture and the wine is ready to drink.
"This is as simple as Beaujolais can get, all berry fruit, crisp acidity and light tannins. The wine is ready to drink."
"This simple wine offers red berry and banana flavors. With its light structure and soft fruit, it is open and ready to drink."
"A heavy, sweet-seeming oak coating totally dominates the flavors of this soft-textured low-acid wine. It has baking spices, toasted bread and vanilla, while any fruity component is very subdued."
"Flat aromas of yeast, vanilla and animal cracker cookies lead to a palate that's more amorphous than tight. Bitter flavors of green onion and grassy citrus fruits fail to come around on the finish."
"This screw cap wine is made to be simple and affordable and it is, with a reduced sensibility to the big amount of oak on offer and a harshness to the waxy apple flavor."
"It's not hard to pick out the variety of this wine, with its japaleo jelly and wild strawberry notes. Light in body, with a decent vein of acidity, enjoy soon before the fruit notes drop off."
The cranberry and raspberry aromas show volatility that distracts. The flavors are lightly sweet with a tart finish.
"This is a strange wine. The wood aging has taken away the fruit, leaving spice and acidity in its place."
An odd aroma of peanut skin pervades over muddled cherry tones. The palate is light and delicately structured with soft tannins and shots of cranberry and berries.
"High-toned aromas of cherry and raspberry are partnered with hints of violets on the nose of this light red. The flavors are fresh, yet fleeting, with a quick finish."
"Huge oak and an intensity of ripe flavor give this wine a harsh edginess that's hard to dispel. Compost, coconut and a green hint of bay leaf or cedar mix in a disjointed way."
"This mostly colorless ros of Carmenre opens with gritty aromas of orange peel. A tangy palate lacks depth, while this tastes sour and generic, with little virtue to the finish."
"An unusual combination of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc has yielded a yeasty-smelling bubbly with little to no fruit on the nose or palate. This tastes mostly like salad, with the vinaigrette and shallots added in. On the plus side, it feels pretty good."
One whiff tells you this ros of Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot is all about pyrazines. A high level of citric acid drives a palate that tastes of orange extract and gritty bitterness. Beyond tang there's not much to a sharp finish.
Rustic gamy aromas of burnt leaves and stewed fruit are sketchy. A raw edgy palate feels tannic and resiny. Stalky berry flavors topped with forced oak end with a mix of wood resin and chocolate notes.
"Briny aromas of seashell include notes of petrol and motor oil. A watery palate is just O.K., while this tastes barely of fruit in front of a bitter-leaning finish."
"This estate-grown wine carries notes of coconut lotion and melon on the nose. Light in profile, with mild acidity, creamy peach flavors lead to a light sour-butter note on the finish."
"Herbal plum and berry aromas are briary at first and then outright herbaceous as this breathes. A heavy, grabby palate sets up berry flavors that are as green as fresh-picked bell peppers. A minty finish confirms that this is an underdeveloped Cabernet."
"Bland apple aromas don't stray far from neutral, while this is monotonous on the palate. Oily, slightly bitter stone-fruit flavors deal a green note of scallion on a lightly oxidized finish."
"Fuzzy peach, honeycomb and citrus mark the nose and palate. This wine is light in feel, with mild concentration and a brown-sugar finish."
"This opens with high-toned fruit aromas of cherry and strawberry that are graced by hits of cedar shavings and balsamic. There's a surprising herbal edge to the palate, which is stalky and linear through the astringent close."
"This wine has an herbal pickle-barrel component that won't appeal to everyone. The flavors are on the tart side, like cranberry and capers, and some hard-edged oak sticks out on the finish."
"This wine has a funkiness to it that's intensely earthy, with a harshness of oak and tannin."
"Honeycomb and wilting citrus blossom notes make up this wine. It's lightly concentrated, with mild acidity and a short finish."
"Overtly vegetal, this wine leads with lettuce and green bean characters, with a note of ripe lemon and a sulphuric, struck-match quality. The slippery-textured palate is a little out of whack and it carries a bitter, green vegetal finish."
"Heavy oak results in savory, smoky campfire aromas. This Chardonnay is weak in build but goes heavy on the wood, resulting in a wine that lacks in fruit tones."
"Cooked blackberries, balsamic vinegar and a hint of pepper show on the nose of this wine, which is over the hill already. Peppercorns, more vinegar and sour berries show on the sip."
"A strong smoky, overtly spicy and buttery character swamps any fruitiness in this full-bodied, heavy-textured and seemingly sweet wine."
White-flower aromas carry the nose and lead to a simple palate of yeasty flavors that that are low on fruit intensity.
"A soupy, sticky nose is all about milk chocolate. On the palate, this candied, seemingly manipulated Cabernet is choppy and hard. Flavors of cough syrup and Nestl's Nesquik end with drying tannins and a final blast of creamy sweet chocolate."
This ros of Cabernet Franc opens with prickly pyrazine-based aromas. A tight palate is O.K. in feel but offers nothing special or exciting. Bitter flavors of bell pepper and onion fail to find any fruit on the finish.
"After many years of calling Pealolen a hidden gem, something is way off with this vintage. Raw oak aromas are chemical, while the wine's herbal blueberry scents are strange. A flabby flat mouthfeel and weedy oak-swollen flavors of mint, alfalfa and wood grain are sketchy. Tasted twice with similar results."
"An odd combo of wet grass, charred nuts, wax and grapefruit on the nose lead into a palate that is on the sour side, with mouth-puckering acidity."
"This funky sparkling wine hails from Chile's deep south, which is notorious for cool short growing seasons. On the nose, this is oxidized, toasty, yeasty and bready. In general, you can forget fruit with this; it's raw and difficult from head to toe."
"Dark and vibrant in color, this is a stellar, jaw-dropping wine, beautiful and powerful, in addition to velvety and complex. It captures a mountain appellation seamlessly, all brawny tannin and lengthy weight. Cranberry, cassis, pencil shavings and wild sage form around a grip of grit and stony mineral."
"This is a bright concentrated wine that's velvety in texture and tone. Dried red cherry and cassis complement an undeniably present flirtation of dusty gravel and rock, a taste of terroir that persists and pleases, as medium-bodied weight gives in to a breadth of spicy complexity."
"This blends 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc into a seamless expression of black pepper, garrigue, clove and pencil. Old world in style and in full command of its power, it offers generously layered, intensely robust tannin and concentration that flirts with richness. Half barrel-fermented and half stainless-steel, it shows promise for cellaring; enjoy best 2023 through 2038."
"From the iconic site atop the mighty mountain appellation, Rainin is exotic in forest, soy and sage notes, with a powerful and densely layered tannin structure. Black pepper, plum and leather are made all the more complex by a tease of rocky ash that gives the wine a distinct mineral character and earthiness. This is one for cellaring. Enjoy 20242034."
"Luxurious in brick, clove and a wealth of black-cherry pie, this is a beautiful succulent wine from the well-farmed site, silky in texture and integrated seamlessly with desirable oak. Saddle leather and black pepper dot the midpalate as a tangle of acidity weaves through, adding freshness and vibrancy. Cellar through 2033."
This is one of the great successes of this vintage. It is generous and rich while also solid and structured. The combination of the essence of black currant and the elegant tannic structure are superb. This is a wine for serious aging and the wine should not be broached before 2026.
"This grand vineyard is one of the jewels of Morey Saint-Denis. The structure and density behind this vintage of the wine is generously impressive, with a dark, dry core and fine tannins. To balance this, the wine has weight, opulent fruit and acidity. The result, as it matures, will be a major wine that will age for many years. Drink from 2025."
"Produced from vines owned by Louis Jadot, this wine, like all the grand crus in Gevry-Chambertin comes from a vineyard halfway up the slope behind the village. It has the proper structure, but such is the richness of this vintage, the fruit is already sumptuous, full of ripe cherry and berry flavors. At the same time, it is elegant and with such as stylish, smart aftertaste. Drink from 2025."
"This is a sumptuous wine as befits a Chardonnay from one of the great white Grand Crus. Intense acidity is spiced by the new-wood aging. A strongly mineral character also marks this powerful wine with generous white and yellow fruits and a zesty, tangy aftertaste. It has a great future. Drink from 2025."
"A bright wave of spicy sarsaparilla rides alongside crunchy, vibrant tones of crisp red cherry, pomegranate and dried herbs in this impressive, well-balanced wine from a tremendous site. Medium bodied, it shows grace and strength in equal measure for superb overall balance."
"This is a wow wine, half barrel-fermented and half fermented in stainless steel, that impresses from start to finish. Candied cassis and emphatic aromas of violet ride along a soft, delicately layered embrace of pillowy tannin and an expansive finish of pepper and clove. It hints at complexities that are still developing in the bottle."
"From one of the series of grand vineyards that line the slope of Gevrey-Chambertin, this powerful and dense wine is packed with tannins as well as beautiful fruit. Its red fruit flavors are supported by a solid structured and concentrated tannins. Despite this power, the wine is stylish, striking a fine balance between structure and fruit. Drink from 2025."
"Aromas of strawberry, Mediterranean brush, blue flower, eucalyptus and a hint of new leather carry over to the radiant, elegantly structured palate along with red cherry and licorice. It's gorgeous, vibrant and almost ethereal, with weightless finesse and ultrafine tannins. Drink through 2026."
"This estate, now performing on top form, has produced a rich, dense wine. Swathes of black fruits underline the generous structure and intensity. At first taste, the tannins are soft but that turns out to be an illusion. The tannins are just richly cushioned within the beautiful fruit. Drink from 2024."
"Incredibly fragrant, this presents an alluring bouquet of dark-skinned berry, cake spice, blue flower, underbrush, crushed rock, exotic spice, spirit-soaked berry and balsamic notes. A combination of finesse and strength, it doles out juicy raspberry, Marasca cherry, licorice and baking spice alongside rounded, velvety tannins that give a smooth texture. It's a compelling wine. Drink through 2029."
"This is a powerful wine, with wood aging that adds richness to the dense tannins. Some tough extraction has not detracted from the ripe fruit or structure and will go as the wine matures. It should be ready to drink from 2026."
"This vintage was ideal for the rich style that this estate has made its own. This wine is full bodied and ripe with black-currant and dark berry fruits. The tannins fall into the cushioned wine with ease and richness. Of course, the wine should be aged, so wait until 2026."
"Smoke and oak commingle on the nose of this bright, crisply underwritten red, with 7% Merlot. Vibrant in red cherry, red licorice and cassis, the flavors are highlighted along a carpet of velvety texture and serious power. Enjoyable now, this should also be lovely and in full grasp of its grace from 20242034."
"From the relatively cooler climes of Eden Valley, Henschke's most famous wine focuses on expressing the unique terroir of its 10 acres of 150 plus year old vineyards rather than on power, oak and extraction. This translates to savory and earthy secondary characters at the fore, highlighting herbal notes with licorice, currants and cocoa powder. The palate is silky and savory, and while the toasty oak notes are apparent, they're kept in check with wonderfully balanced acidity. Approachable now, it will morph into a thing of stunning beauty with time. Drink now2037."
"This is going to be a rich wine. Although it seems tight and closed at this stage, it is possible to imagine the ripe white fruits with citrus tinges that will emerge. Spice and good acidity are part of the mix of this opulent, succulent wine. Drink from 2023."

"Structure is the watchword for this wine. With dark tannins and concentration, it obviously has long-term potential. At the same time, the black-currant fruits are ripe and full bodied, giving rich contrast to the tannins. These two elements will allow this wine to age. It will be ready to drink from 2025."
"The second vintage release of J. Lohr's Signature wine, first produced to commemorate founder Jerry Lohr's 80th birthday. Rich aromas of stewed black plum, blackberry pie, vanilla, clove and prune cake show on the nose. The mouthfeel is rich overall, but with firm tannins in the background that lend structure to the strawberry and blackberry flavors, graced by hints of wood smoke, peppercorn and licorice. Drink now2029."
"This wine is all tannins at this stage, smothering the black fruits. That will change as it matures, revealing dense blackberries and plums as well as keeping its tannins as a base for the exuberant fruitiness. The wine comes from a blend of different parcels that together make up just over four acres of this vineyard owned by Louis Jadot. Drink this wine from 2025."

Delicious sparks of tea and wild strawberry are framed by tightly woven tannins across the broad midpalate, resulting in a velvety texture. The long finish boasts excellent evolution, with underpinnings of cardamom at the end."
"Unfortunately, this very tiny vineyard only makes three barrels of Chardonnay, because this bottling is fantastic in every way. The lively nose shows lemon-lime soda, honeydew, gardenia and sea shells, while the palate is framed by a stunning chalky tension and sizzling acidity. Flavors of honeysuckle and green melon meet with salty ocean spray toward the finish."
"Powerful and structured, this opulent wine is succulent with fruit and dense with dark tannins. It has power and structure, a strongly mineral texture still bursting with youthful fruit.

"This grand cru in the village of Morey-Saint-Denis is grandiose, packed with tannins and fruit, powered by both acidity and swathes of rich black cherries. Both juicy and densely structured, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2025."
"Interesting and intense aromas of baked bread and coffee syrup combine with deep plum fruit, shaved chocolate, toasted wood and hints of caramel and white pepper on the nose of this excellent Syrah. The palate is framed by suave, chalky tannins, carrying dynamic and delicious flavors of black currant, blackberry, black pepper and roasted espresso beans."
"This is from a small block of the proprietor's vineyard and made entirely from one variety. It's gorgeous and perfumed, grippy and hugely structured, with a bright exuberantly complex midpalate of intriguing plum and peppery clove. Gentle and balanced, it's enjoyable now, but will also age. Enjoy best 2024 through 2034."

Thanks to the smooth texture and mouthwatering fruit, you won't detect the 15% abv. Drink through 2029."
"Always one of Italy's premier white wines, Pieropan's gorgeous 2015 Calvarino sets a new benchmark. Opening with heady aromas of white spring wildflower, citrus blossom, aromatic herb and crushed rock, the savory palate delivers layers of lemon drop, ripe apple, juicy pear and tangy mineral notes. It's concentrated yet elegant and thoroughly delicious. Drink through 2025."
"This is a firm wine, bombastic in tannin structure and oak, with a nuanced hint of noble reduction. Youthfully grippy in a thicket of tar, it bristles in black currant, black cherry and sage, dusted in mountain rock, black pepper and a delightful sniff of violet. Entirely barrel-fermented, it should do well in time, enjoyed best from 2023 through 2033 and quite possibly beyond."
"This rich wine is full of fruit and structured with layers of tannin. It's also stylish and elegant, with a suave texture that is already attractive. Black fruits mix with the structure to give a wine that will age well. Drink from 2026."
"This wine's lip-smacking peach and apricot flavors are slathered with buttery toast notes, yet kept lively by vibrant acidity. Despite the almost decadent flavors, it maintains its precision through a stunningly long finish and gets even better with aeration. Drink now through 2028."
"This is a beautifully understated and refined wine, savory in character with complex layers of black olive, lavender and black tea. Secondary characteristics come into play on the silky smooth palate, a mix of old-world cedar, pencil shavings, graphite and gun smoke."

"Beautifully oaky and unctuously voluptuous, this is from a tremendously farmed site in the throes of the Petaluma Gap. Richly layered in deep interwoven layers of butterscotch and brioche, its length and breadth are punctuated by sharp teases of wild fennel and nutmeg."
"It's difficult to pick a favorite out of the marvelous Brick House 2015s, but this is it. Native yeasts, biodynamic farming and minimal handling all contribute to an old-school method, though it's a cutting edge wine. From the opening aroma, the complexities compound, offering pepper, spice, cranberry, candied rose petal, red berry and cherry notes. Simply a stunning value."

"Luscious notes of pink grapefruit and greengage plum are ripe yet keenly balanced in this invigorating dry Riesling. It's buoyantly fruity and forward now, but nuances of candle wax, spice and sun-baked clay predict even greater depth to come. Beautiful already but likely to intensify further from 20202025."
"Profound mineral notes of crushed slate and river rocks differentiate this goldkap bottling from the producer's regular labels. Fleshy white peach and yellow cherry flavors are sweet and plump, but cast in breathtaking layers of shimmering minerality. Electric acidity pierces through a long finish. Although it's a stunner already, it will improve well through 2030 and likely beyond."
"This rich, sumptuous wine is both structured and generous. Bold red fruits give it weight, concentration and a good balance between acidity and ripe richness. It comes from a vineyard close to some of the greatest Burgundy grand crus, which explains the wine's structure and potential. Drink from 2022."
"The tiny Ribbon Ridge AVA is becoming well known for Oregon Riesling. This succulent, fruit-packed young wine displays impeccably clean apple, peach, pear, apricot and melon flavors. Minerally acidity keeps it lively and fresh, and its intensity and balance suggest it will age for decades. Drink now through 2035 and beyond."
"This first effort by Westwood from an Anderson Valley vineyard favored by Copain and Littorai is a stunner. A deft touch of spicy oak lifts the aroma, and meets compelling, intricate notes of red and black cherry, rhubarb and mushroom on the palate. This elegant, memorable wine has great structure due to firm acidity and lightly gripping tannins, which surround and support the wonderful, exotic and complex flavors. Best after 2020."

The sip offers tart and exotic plums wrapped up in an herbal cape of thyme and potpourri. This will please many palates."
"There is a tough, tannic core to this otherwise ripe and fruity wine. All to the good, as this will allow the bold, ripe wine to age well. Black-currant fruits are already showing their hand and will intensify, bringing in richness and a dense texture. Drink this wine from 2025."
"A sinuous line of tannins runs through this structured wine. It lifts the dark plum and berry fruits and give shape to the spicy, firm wine. As the estate builds in strength, the style of this perfumed, stylish wine will be seen as a benchmark. Drink from 2025."
"One of the furthest west of the Saint-Julien estates, this property has been greatly improved with investment from Japanese owner Suntory. The wine from 2015 is dense and impressively concentrated, perfumed black-currant fruits working well with the crisp acidity and solid structure. Drink from 2025."
"This vineyard, on the hill above the city of Nuits-St.-Georges, is widely seen as the top premier cru of the appellation. Certainly this rich, structured wine with its great fruit and firm tannins is serious and ageworthy. Ripe, full and concentrated, it needs to age. Drink from 2024."

It even drinks beautifully two days after being opened and should age well."

"Extreme amounts of roasted beef and grilled lamb aromas meet with rosemary, bay leaf and crushed rainbow peppercorns for a deliciously savory and spicy nose on this bottling, which uses a touch of Viognier but doesn't offer any overt fruit. Those meaty qualities ride into the palate, where burnt bacon flavors meet with tar, black pepper and a hint of black currant."
"This is a powerfully tannic and oaky wine from a warm site and a warm vintage that doesn't deny its ripeness and concentration of flavor. Clove, red currant and pencil shavings wrap around a gravelly core of midpalate weight and power, as specks of dust and pepper reveal themselves on the lengthy finish."
"This wine has the structure that is a part of a fine Vosne-Romane. Its dense texture is balanced by the great red fruit and good acidity. Of course, the wine is still so young, its fruit still crisp and not yet mellow. Wait until 2026 to drink this impressive wine."
"This expertly blends a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, in that order. Grippy, it's quite savory, highlighted in cedar and pencil shavings that dot a sublime, supple core of tannin, seasoned in dried herb."
"This elegant estate, with its views down to the Gironde estuary, has produced an excellent 2015. It is properly firm with tannins although this structure is well balanced with the ripe, stylish black-currant fruits and acidity. A juicy finish bodes well for the future. Drink this generous wine from 2025."

The wood aging has been well judged to give some spice and ginger flavors that will become more integrated over the next few months. Then the wine will develop slowly and majestically, probably being ready to drink from 2023."
"This is the winery's only non-Dundee Hills bottling, and it brings aromatic notes of earthy stem, leaf and barrel. It's richly layered in red and black fruit, with plum, cherry, pipe tobacco and black tea notes accenting the complex, dark and deep palate. Even in the extraordinary Domaine Serene lineup, this wine overdelivers."

"This new take on Ovum's Memorista cuvethe winery's flagshipis its ripest Riesling. It was fermented in a thousand-liter Austrian cask, with a small percentage of botrytized fruit. It's almost liquorous, with botanical elements that accents its lime, candied citrus and dried papaya flavors. It's potent and packed with flavor yet impeccably balanced."
"Unctuous, sun-drenched peach and apricot are glazed with honey, earth and spice in this luminous medium-sweet wine. A silken texture on the midpalate is accented by hits of lime and crushed minerals. Its fruity, forward flavors are stunning already, but there's too much complexity here that's yet to develop. Hold till at least 2021 and it will continue to reward for years to come."

"Still solid and firm, this wine has impressive potential. Its tannins are a reminder that the vineyard is close to Morey Saint-Denis. Under those tannins runs a seam of ripe fruits that will develop richly as the wine matures. Drink from 2024."

Bright and fresh in lifted acidity, it offers length and balance within a velvety complex texture."
"This is a tremendous example of a cool-climate Syrah, enhanced by 12% Viognier, with cracked black peppercorn, gamy lamb meat, tarragon, rosemary, soy sauce, mint and black currant all present on the nose. The pepper-crusted meat flavor with blackberry jam shows strongly on the sip, finishing with hints of butterscotch and vanilla."
"Explosive floral and fruit aromas leap from the glass in this brilliant bottling, which is bursting with plump red cherry, bundles of rose petals and just a touch of green peppercorn to keep it herbally intriguing.

"While subdued on the nose, there's intensity and persistence to be found in this deeply concentrated dry Riesling.

Hold until 2020, though it's bound to keep improving for years beyond."

The mouthfeel is silky, while an herbal underbelly and lingering clove flavor persists through the finish."
"Penfold's latest Grange release delivers all of the power, rich fruit and toasty oak Australia's most famous wine is noted for. It is incredibly beguiling though, even in its infancy. Autumnal notes of dried leaves, flowers, sap and dark berries abound, with a raw meat and miso savoriness. The power on the palate is balanced by ultrafine tannins and a finesse that makes this drinkable now with plenty of time in decanter and paired alongside roast lamb, beef, or something equally hearty. Still, it'd be a shame not to cellar for at least the next five years. Revisit in 7, 15, or 30 years."
"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon from the famous historic site, with 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot. It startles in beauty and grace, with plenty of power and concentration. It's a charismatic wine, bright in red currant and black cherry and a soft, supple texture that holds an underlying grip and toasty oak spice."

The palate is peppery and herbally laced with bay, oregano and crushed pencil flavors, with tense but approachable tannins. Drink now through 2023."
"Lemon spray with hints of flint, light smoke, chalk and toasted oak show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling by Greg Brewer. It's really tightly wound on the sip, with expressive grapefruit pith and squeezed citrus as well as a distinctive Brie-rind note. A light flash of roasted marshmallow pops on the finish."

"This comes from a small vineyard that lies between Echzeaux Grand Cru and Clos de Vougeot Grand Cru. It has the structure of both, perhaps without quite the intensity.

"This wine is tight, closed and firm, which shows its youth because it also has great richness and a dense fruitiness that will develop well in the future. The wine is concentrated, as is proper for Gevrey-Chambertin, and densely packed. It will be ready to drink from 2024."
"An immense wine, this is bold and rich with powerful yellow and white stone fruits. It comes from one of the Montrachet vineyards that makes the greatest white wines in Burgundy. Under Julie Belland's hand, it shows in the generous, opulent nature of the wine with its balance of fruit and tight texture. Drink this very fine wine from 2023."
"This spicy, toasty wine is showing its wood aging as well as plenty of fruit. It is rich and generous, with the natural opulence of Volnay. The red-berry fruits are full of juiciness, backed up by fine tannins. Drink this potentially delicious wine from 2022."
"A lovely appellation wine, this has a quiet, floral entry and twisted characteristics of anise, baked apple and vanilla crme brle. Medium-bodied, complex and buoyant in acidity, it offers a wealth of flavor and elegance."
"From the site high atop the Petaluma Gap part of the coast, above Gap's Crown, this is inviting in every way. Black raspberry is seasoned in cardamom and forest pine as a tannic backbone provides structure and strength. A hit of citrus highlights the fresh persistent acidity."
"Dry and sublime, with undeniable elegance, this is textured, gravelly and integrated with subtle power. Fennel, white peach and lemon rind highlight the toasty oak, making for a complex balanced whole. It would be difficult to find a wine of this quality for this price."
"Bountiful boysenberry fruit shows alongside a muddy loamy clay minerality on the nose of bottling, which is lifted further by crushed lavender aromas.

"A perennial knockout, this wine is juicy and fresh yet somewhat brooding in structured flavors of red cherry, strawberry and plum. With intriguing layers of earth and forest floor framed by tight-grained tannins, it's a sophisticated and complex experience. A deep boysenberry note adds richness on the finish."
"Earthy forest and twig support a medium build of integrated acidity and balanced fruit in this blend named for the proprietor. Aged in 55% new oak, blackberry and black licorice dominate the profile against a fine-grained texture of toasty wood and depth."
"Aromas of ripe stone fruit, hazelnut and tropical fruit emerge on this savory, structured white. Refined and full of flavor, the palate doles out juicy yellow peach, apricot and a hint of ginger, while almond lingers on the long finish."
"The second release of this tte de cuve offering from Roco is two thirds Pinot Noir and one third Chardonnay, and winemaker Rollin Soles (Argyle) seems to have saved his best for it. Matching intense fruit to classic Champagne-style finesse, it's brightly layered with apple, pear and Mandarin orange flavors. It has a fine bead and finishes clean, with citrus and toast highlights."
"This spicy wine is rich and full bodied, with a solid, firm structure. From one of the most attractively named of vineyards, the wine has juicy red fruits that contrast with the tannins, giving a ripe balance.

Drink from 20202034."

The palate is woody, full of dank mushrooms, wild berries and green peppercorns."
"Lingua Franca, a Larry Stone/Dominique Lafon project, offers a challenging, absorbing lineup of Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs. The Avni bottling is tangy and tight, with white peach and melon fruit and hints of toasted nuts and butter. The finish extends gracefully, keeping you riveted."
"Lush red cherry and rosewater aromas meet with muddled sage, pepper dust and wild herbs on the nose of this excellent bottling, where rich fruit and herbal intrigue collide. Thyme, dried sage and even broadleaf parsley flavors show on the sip, set against a background of piquant cranberry and tart red currant, with bountiful energy that carries through the entire palate."
"This structured wine also offers juicy, elegant fruit. Full of black plums, spice from judicious wood aging and acidity, its core remains to develop. The wine needs to age so drink after 2024."
"This generous, ripe wine is filled with fine tannins as well as juicy black-currant fruits. It is approachable in the sense that the fruit is so delicious. However, watch for those tannins that are firm and dense and will allow the wine to age. Best to wait until 2024."
"There's a very Gamay-like quality to this bottling, with loads of crushed gravel and schist-like minerality sprinkled atop light cranberry, crushed carnations and slightly ripe raspberry. It hits the palate softly then comes a sharp acidity and then that mellows to allow soil-driven flavors and candied red fruit to combine seamlessly."

This represents a tremendously complete sensory experience."
"This always highly anticipated, nontraditional blend of 56% Syrah, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot really shows off Daniel Daou's deft hand in the cellar.

"All it takes is one sniff to know that this is in fine shape, because the mix of woodsy spice, toast and dark fruit aromas is ideal.

"Thick and dark in the glass, this is a very roasty wine on the nose, with aromas of toasted chocolate, smoked beef, hearty blackberry and a bit of purple-flower freshness.

It would be easy to drink the whole bottle."
"Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 60% of this wine to Merlot's 40%, the grapes coming from three different vineyard sites, including Brokenrock.

This is a tremendous value for the quality."

This should cellar beautifully. Drink 20192037."

"Mimi Casteel is the grower, hence the cuve name. A full 70% included whole clusters, foot-stomped and barrique-aged. That new oak shows minimally, and the fruit, at least for now, is somewhat subsumed by stem and leaf flavors. It's a demanding style that will reward long-term aging. The texture and complexity begin to emerge after many hours of aeration. Drink 20222035."

"Very light in color, this tightly wound bottling shows aromas of crisp Asian pear, chilled Pink Lady apples, sharp green melon rind, wet stone and a definite grassy quality. The palate is a study in wound-up freshness that's on the verge of bursting, with more Asian pear and hints of pluot riding an extremely pithy texture."
"Vanilla and crisp minerality play together in this ripe wine with steely core. It has intense acidity, a lively, bright texture plus a flinty edge that will allow it to age. The wine, still young, will be ready from 2020."

It is soft on entry, with a nice balance of fruit and spice flavors, in particular black cherry, dark plum, fennel, sage and mocha. The tannins start off very mild and gradually increase in intensity, lingering through a licorice and cherry finish."
"Clean fruit, dried autumn leaves, balsamic vinegar, black olives and cola notes all lead into a full-bodied palate that's chewy with savory, earthy tones and big, well-structured tannins. There's a fair lick of oak here but it should soften with time in cellar. Drink 20192032."
"This producer does not believe in much oak aging (in this case 3%), but even that small amount brings out richness while leaving the delicious fruit right in place. From one of the top, ripe premier crus in Chablis, this wine is rich, creamy while never losing the proper tang of citrus and bright acidity. Drink from 2019."

The palate is dominated by eucalyptus oil, pine needle and dewy juniper flavors, set against dark cranberry and black raspberry fruit. The finish is redolent with menthol and cedar."
"Initial oak-driven aromas of grilled and smoked meats don't allow for much fruit expression on the nose. A jammy, plush palate is solid but not too hard or tannic. Spicy, toasty flavors of plum, raisin and licorice expire with mild heat and burn on the finish. Drink through 2032."

Rounded salt and stone fruit flavors show on the sip, but the citrusy acidity is persistent, cutting through the slight butter warmth. Caramel pops on the finish."

The tannins are tightly grained yet silky. A wintery Cab that could be cracked open now with food or cellared through 2027."

"Aromas of dried cherry, iron and smoke are set against a mineral-driven backdrop of volcanic soil, wet gravel and slate on the nose of this bottling. The palate is a bit like sucking on gravel at first: very schist-driven and flint-like. Then come waves of pomegranate, carnation and, on the finish, vanilla."
"Fermented in a concrete egg, this fascinating wine stands apart from any standard Oregon Pinot Gris. Its texture and subtle details speak to why winemakers are fascinated by these particular fermentation vessels, which are neither cheap nor easy to master. Its solid pear fruit is dappled with bread, pollen and powdered lemon notes."
"A true old-vine bottling, this comes off the original block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath. It's a complex, spicy and balanced amalgam of berry, cherry and plum fruit. As is often the case, it rewards aeration and attention. The acid/tannin balance is just about perfect."
"Ken Wright oversees production for Angela Estate, bringing his 30-plus years of Oregon experience to the task.

Other highlights include whiffs of cherry tobacco and coffee. It's smooth and appealing and may be cellared for up to a decade."

The flavors are crisp and strong with more white flowers, and the grippy chalky texture and solid acidity make for a lovely wine altogether."

"This full-bodied, rich wine is open and ripe. Delicious layers of yellow fruits are sustained by the mineral texture and crisp acidity. Although this wine is good to drink now, it will be much better if aged further, so wait until late 2018."
"Fresh green florals, lime zest and yellow plum are tart and invigorating in this wine. Showing a bit of a lime-and-mineral cocktail, it's spry in texture yet penetrating and juicy. The long finish is softly honeyed. Lovely already but should drink well through 2027, likely beyond."
"This complex wine neatly weaves blue and purple fruit flavors, with soft leather, dried herb, cannabis and smoke accents. It's drinking quite well and should remain in peak condition for another half decade. Drink now through 2025."
"A dense wine that is still young, this is full, textured and with plenty of both fruit and spice. A creamy vanilla character fills out this ripe wine and gives an extra dimension. Drink this rich wine from 2019."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec is plush, deep and chewy. Its earthy, spicy plum and berry aromas show a hint of eucalyptus and mint. Matching the nose, it tastes of roasted blackberry touched up with leafy spice notes. An herbal tea- and pepper-inflected finish offers a nice conclusion. Drink through 2025."
"Dark licorice, anise, blackberry and prune aromas set this up a for rough palate with sandpaper tannins. A blend of Malbec and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, it tastes of dark, toasty black fruits with herbal shadings. Its chewy finish fades slowly. Drink through 2026."
"Tightly wound in its youth, this is a spicy integrated wine that offers black tea and baked strawberry-rhubarb flavors alongside bold aromas of rose petal and forest floor. Moderate structure supports the moderate ripeness and expansiveness on the palate."
"This opens with a pretty nose that mixes floral scents with baby powder notes. A flavorful melding of bergamot tea, lemon and honey keeps it interesting on the palate, with enough acidity to keep it tasting dry."
"Boysenberry compote, wet asphalt, black peppercorns and dried thyme make for a classic and compelling nose on this countywide blend. Rustic sagebrush and wild thyme flavors show on the sip, set against dark red plums and a gravelly minerality."
"This dense and tannic wine, from the lower slope of the village, is firm and solid. It has a powerful core of tannins as well as rich black fruits that are developing behind the structure. Concentration and dryness mean the wine needs to age, so drink from 2021."
"Plump, dark strawberry, lavish kirsch, along with cola, cinnamon and allspice show on the nose of this rich bottling from a vineyard on the small appellation's northern end. Vanilla, caramel and cherry-jubilee flavors show on the ripe sip, where a solid tannic tension arises on the finish."
"A deeper shade of pink, this bottling shows raspberry, rose petal, crushed gravel and wet slate on the impressively mineral nose. There is a complex texture to the palate, which is loaded with crushed rock and chalk, and also shows candied raspberry and cherry flavors."
"A slight hint of hay yellow in the glass, this bottling shows a clean line of cantaloupe, plumeria, daffodil and vanilla-spiced pear sauce on the nose. The palate is grippy with lemon skin tension, offering richer yellow-peach-cream flavors against that pithy texture. Great combo of ripeness with restraint."
"There is a strong floral character to the nose of this single vineyard bottling, with pungent carnation and violet as well as red currant, black raspberry and incense. The sip is energetic with tart acidity, yet the mouthfeel is soft, creamy and nearly chalky, showing cranberry and cherry tomato flavors."
"Concentrated aromas of black cherry, earthy rust, cedar and warm vanilla make for a very pleasing and standard nose on this bottling. There is a lot of baking spice on the palate as well as plums, black cherries, sandalwood and a hint of cocoa, making for a complex sip."
This wine has a fresh carbonic liveliness on the palatea burst of bubbly cherry and pomegranate flavor that is supported by sturdy tannins. Toasted oak is complemented by Asian five-spice and pretty aromas of rose.
"This wine is juicy and broad in tannin, with a gritty layered texture of black cherry, blackberry and minty menthol. Cola spice rides along the palate with ease, providing a savory touch within a light-bodied weight."
"This blends together the grapes of several vineyards within the appellation, including single-vineyard sites like Leras, Peters and Nunes. Brightly layered, it shines in strawberry and pomegranate tanginess, complemented by fresh acidity and a persistence of rose."
"Set at the eastern limit of Santenay next to Chassagne-Montrachet, this vineyard produces structured wines that reflect its neighbor. In this vintage, Valrie and Philippe Jeannot took advantage of rich red-cherry juiciness with a touch of pepper and almost refreshing acidity. Drink this succulent wine from 2021."
"Red berry, licorice and exotic spice aromas follow through to the smooth palate along with raspberry compote and menthol. Polished tannins provide supple support. Drink through 2021."
"Perfumed, this 66% Cabernet Sauvignon and 34% Syrah blend showcases both varieties well, allowing a generously succulent, fleshy mouthfeel to impart flavors of cherry, vanilla and smoky oak. Made in a rounded approachable style, it retains acidity and complexity, nods to its mountainous beginnings."
"This blend of Petite Sirah and Syrah is beautifully structured and complex, robust in black cherry, blackberry and a bite of lasting tannin. Succulent secondary characteristics linger into black leather, pepper and earthy root."
"Fleshy and plump compared to this producer's more mineral medium-sweet kabinett, this bottling is a glorious fountain of lusciously sweet yellow peach, apple and tangerine flavors. It's still zesty and spry in texture, with riveting pin points of acidity that linger on the finish."
"This is a clear, fresh, downright pretty wine, though not as powerful as the 2015. Its lovely cherry fruit comes with a hint of underbrush, and the finish carries a streak of cola. This is a wine to enjoy young, so drink now through the early 2020s."
"Smashed blackberry and mulberry mingle with black pepper and beef char on the nose of this bottling. It's still extremely young on the palate, not quite ready to release its bounty, but flavors of seared beef, tar, crushed marjoram, white pepper and forest floor indicate a compelling future."
"Dark and toasty barrel flavors frame tight black cherry fruit in this wine. It has herbal highlights that bring cannabis to mind and dark chocolate notes that wrap up the finish. It's a blocky, substantial wine best consumed now through 2022."
"Scents of yellow flower, ripe orchard fruit and aromatic herb lead the way on this round, medium-bodied white. On the savory palate, an underlying mineral note reminiscent of oyster shell underscores mature pear, yellow apple, fennel and a hint of honey. A hazelnut note marks the close."
"Zesty lime and lemon notes reverberate from nose to finish in this delightfully spry, sweet wine. Lush white peach and honey notes are lip smacking and juicy but calibrated deftly with acidity and subtle nuances of earth and mineral. A remarkable value for such an elegant wine."
"This Shiraz from Penfolds's original Magill Vineyard, located just outside of Adelaide, is ever so slightly less rich and muscular than its RWT counterpart. Notes of raspberry, black cherry, dust, earth and slight meatiness are very nearly overwhelmed by powerful oak tannins at the moment, but they're fine grained and balanced by crisp acidity. Needs time in the bottle. Drink 20192037."
"While sun-kissed peach perfumes the nose, just a trace of sweetness rims the palate of this taut, mineral-driven kabinett. Sweet-tart tangerine and lime flavors are spine tingling and persistent, leading a long, salt-and-lime finish."
"This unique wine, labeled ros, is a lovely rose-toned copper. But is it really a ros, or just a rich, phenolic white? However you label it, call it delicious; its rose petal, bee pollen and strawberry scents and flavors are concentrated and creamy. It spent six months on the leeshalf in stainless steel and half in neutral oak."
"Given nearly two years in 30% new French oak, this aged wine is thickly wrapped in blackberry bramble and solidly built tannins, with a baked quality to the fruit. Robust oak leans into full-bodied concentrated flavors of tobacco, clove and mocha."
"This aromatic wine is the ripest of the winery's fine lineup of 2015 Pinots, with a sweet, soft, round and smooth entry. Its pretty strawberry and cherry fruit is swathed in mocha, proving supple and immediately appealing. The still slightly stiff tannins suggest further improvement awaits over the next five years."
"Delicate whiffs of exotic spice accent luscious tangerine and peach flavors in this off-dry Riesling. While ripe and lip smackingly honeyed, it's a briskly textured wine, with cutting lemon-lime acidity. Lime zest lingers through a long, lingering finish. Drink now through 2025."
"This wine smells toasty and creamy. Like all of Catena's 2013 Malbecs, it's wiry in feel, with screaming acidity. That electric feel carries into its plum and currant flavors, which have oaky, wood spice accents.Drink through 2035."
"The blueberry and boysenberry aromas in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah include tea and cardamom notes. Its jammy, pulpy palate is thick and chewy, tasting of herbal blue fruits, blueberry in particular. Minty on the finish, it deals dashes of nutmeg and cardamom for a hint of the exotic. Drink through 2024."
"This is the winery's reserve-level Chardonnay, and just three barrels were produced. It offers extra concentration and a silky mix of apple and pear fruit, with a touch of minerality. The finish, which is long and balanced, is enwrapped in almond flavor."
"Sonja Magdevski is exploring what Grenache can do across Santa Barbara County, and this appellation blend is a bit more simple that her single-vineyard expressions, but gives a great sense of what she is up to. Purple hibiscus, light mulberry, rooibos tea and exotic cherries show on the fresh nose, while the palate is delicate with hints of plum, black raspberry, star anise and vanilla dust."
"Quite light, cloudy and blood-orange colored in the glass, this oxidative bottling from Thompson Vineyard, which spent 140 days on skins, is unlike any Grenache on the market. Aromas of plum, fig, pepper, strawberry wine and balsamic vinegar lead into a palate of sour red plum and white pepper. Fascinating for wine geeks, though perhaps too weird for most."
"This is one of two wines made by Saint-Julien Chteau Beychevelle from vines in the Haut-Mdoc. It has the rich, generous fruit of this vintage, with ripe plum flavors and concentrated tannins. Perfumed acidity and a dry core will allow the wine to age further. Drink from 2020."
"This 11-acre, family-owned property has produced a generous, opulent wine. A blend of 75% Merlot with Cabernet Franc, it shows the ripeness of the fruit in this vintage giving a rich, dark plum-flavored wine. Tannins lie at the core of this cushion of fruit. Still young, it needs time and will be best from 2020."
"An excellent vintage of this east-facing block-sourced wine, it seems to have ripened gracefully. It's flavorful and concentrated, with raspberry and cherry fruit. There's a hint of chicken stock on both the nose and palate and firm, astringent tannins that balance out the finish."
"Lightly honeyed, this citrus-flavored wine comes a vineyard southeast of Chablis. It is all fruit although strong mineral texture gives it shape as well as sustaining the lemon acidity. Drink this wine from late 2018."
"Earth, smoke and slate contrast sweet, juicy bursts of white peach, raspberry and grapefruit in this spry kabinett. It's unctuously fruity yet zesty, finishing on a long, chalky mineral tone. While integrated and irresistible already, it's likely to maintain fresh appeal till at least 2025."
"Dark tar and asphalt aromas are more than an accent to this wine's bold berry and coffee scents. Its plump, chunky palate is more static than lively, with baked plum and spiced cherry flavors. The finish is tannic and a touch heavy, with low acidity. Drink through 2019."
"Here's a solid, polished effort from winemaker Tom Fitzpatrick. It neatly weaves together blue plum and black cherry flavors, highlighted with pipe tobacco and a hint of caramel. Its smooth tannins are framed with light composted earth notes."
"This is an impressively made wine, offering a tart red currant around savory notes of fresh tobacco, clove, cedar and graphite. Robustly built up front, it shows balance through the midpalate and a firm control of its ripeness, dotted in baking spice and pepper."
"Savory smoke and earth notes blow off with aeration revealing zesty green plum and herb tones. Electric shocks of acidity and a deep slate undertone accentuate its lean, lithe profile. The finish is moderately long but invigorating. Drink now through 2022."
"This wine starts shy but after some time in glass reveals bramble berries, cooked meat and wild herbs. More bramble fruit bursts onto the palate morphing into big, drying tannins that are balanced by a good lick of acidity and a long, herbal and cherry-cola finish. Drink now2027."
"This stand-out wine is not showy, and has nice fresh fruit flavors shaded by baking spices, a good, lightly gripping texture due to moderate tannins and supportive acidity, and a lingering finish. It's well balanced and not at all tiring to keep sipping."
"A strong shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling shows aromas of whipped cream, preserved lemon peels and a hint of smoked white meat, all honed in by a citrusy sharpness. The palate proves fresh, bright and tense, making the mouth water with a hint of sea salt along with creamy cherimoya and a touch more smoke."
"This creamy and smooth wine tastes of mashed apple, papaya and pear. Almost half was aged in new oak, which contributes to that silky mouthfeel and to its butterscotch-laced finish. A hint of minerality infuses the acidity. Though young, this first-time effort is delicious and ready for immediate enjoyment."
"Young and showing primary fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, this wine isn't shy about incorporating stem and grape skin flavors. It's a style that favors longterm aging over immediate accessibility and will reward decanting and/or cellaring. Drink 20202030."
"This wine is a good representation of this appellation. It is structured with tight, dry tannins as well as juicy red fruits that shine through in this vintage. Give this wine more time and drink from 2019."
"Lovely cherry lollipop flavors introduce this smooth and tasty effort. Its juicy and irresistable sweet fruit is highlighted with sliced orange and lemon peel notes. A streak of coffee runs through the finish, and the wine is substantial enough to cellar for another half decade or longer."
"The first-ever vineyard-designated Riesling from Love & Squalor, this is bone dry and as tart as lemon juice. Its green apple fruit shows excellent concentration. For acid lovers, this will be a revelation. If acid isn't your thing, look to the winery's regular Riesling instead."
"This mineral, crisp wine offers concentrated acidity and lemon flavors. It is rounded, rich with yellow fruits and with a tight texture that will allow the wine to age. Produced from vines up to 62-years-old, it will be ready to drink from 2019."
"This is a rounded wine, a blend of many different parcels from across Nuits St.-Georges. With its tannins and red berry fruits well intact, it has a dry core as well as bright acidity to balance, giving a wine that will become generous as it ages. Drink from 2021."
"There is plenty of toasty oak on the nose of this reserve bottling, but it's judiciously applied and cut by lemon balm, Asian pear, hot croissant and pecan oil aromas. The sip also shows a savory oak-smoke character, but the midpalate is all about lemon cream and butter-basted apple pie, with a touches of vanilla, cinnamon and cashew riding into the finish."
"Light in color, this bottling shows suave pomegranate and piquant cranberry on the nose alongside subtle potpourri, bay leaf and juniper. The palate packs in wild forest flavors of sage, thyme and more bay leaf, with a slight hint of green olive giving complexity to the tart red fruit."
"A wonderful combination of spices, fruits and good structure make this an outstanding wine. It has a spicy, lightly smoky aroma that also includes black cherries, leading to deep cherry and berry flavors accented by cinnamon and clove. The texture is silky, supported by mild fine-grained tannins."
"From a north-facing, late-ripening section of the estate planted to 100% Pommard clone, this brings a juicy mix of spicy berry and cherry fruit. There's a suggestion of chocolate malt as well, and a mineral touch in the underlying acidity. Among the winery's sensational 2015 releases, this might be the lightest."
"A blend of barrels sourced from Sineann's impressive single vineyard program, this offers ripe plum and black cherry fruit in a smooth, supple package. Its polished tannins fill out the finish, adding a light hint of chocolate."
"Reduced, this wine is supple and succulent in raspberry, plum and cherry-like cassis. Firm, integrated tannins give it structure to spare and a place to hang its ripeness."
"Lush aromas of coffee cake, cappuccino and caramel meet with both bright red fruit and a hint of kirsch on this twist-top ready-to-drink blend of 43% Cabernet Franc, 28% Petit Verdot, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon and 7% Merlot. Juicy black plums and cherries show on the palate, which is relatively light on its feet with a firm enough structure, finishing on more cocoa, mocha and latte flavors."
"This wine's resiny oak and lemon aromas require some time and air to settle. It's full and round in feel, even a bit pulpy. Salted apple and wood spice flavors last on the finish, with good acidity and a buttered popcorn note that's not overwhelming. Drink through 2020."
"This wine leads with roasted cashew scents and follows with tart raspberry and cherry fruit and a light dusting of cocoa. Although aged 10 months in 20% new French oak, it emphasizes minerality and minimizes the influence of the barrels."
"It seems trite to call an Oregon wine Burgundian, but in this instance it fits perfectly. Elegant from start to finish, it combines lemon and grapefruit flavors with minerally acidity, driving the palate forward with sleek, racy freshness that calls a particularly excellent Mcon to mind. Roughly one third was aged in clay amphora, the rest in neutral oak."
"There's a lot to like in this wine: raspberry, cherry, baking spices, mocha, violets and milky coffee lead into a medium-bodied palate complete with raisiny fruit and satiny tannins. A warming wintery red perfect with a roast."
"A broadly defined, soft round red wine made with the utmost attention and time in French oak, this estate-driven effort is impressive in strawberry, cherry and blueberry cobbler goodness, rich flavors that wrap around substantial tannins. The persistent sensibility on the nose is floral in violet and mountain sage."
"Dark violet in color, this wine has aromas of black cherry and fennel bulb. A network of silky tannins supports well-integrated flavors of blackberry, plum and anise that culminate in a surprisingly bright cherry finish."
"So named because Counoise takes to long to ripen that it makes winemakers' collective blood boils, this bottling from Glenrose Vineyard is a great example of a lighter red wine from Paso Robles. Red cherry, rust, crushed gravel and dried herbs show on the nose, while the palate carries oregano, marjoram and a touch of cardamom against light red cherry and cranberry flavors. It's lively and fresh."
"This wine's potent grass and grapefruit scents greet you, and similar flavors follow. It would be easy to mistake this for New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, given its intensity and aroma. In the mouth, it's immaculately fresh and crisp, with steely acidity. Citrus rind flavors continue through its long finish."
"Maybe it's the fir tree branch and cone on the label, but there seems to be a hint of pine needle in this wine's aroma. That scent sneaks into its rhubarb and black cherry flavors, along with a touch of root beer and beet root. Those components may sound disparate, but they blend nicely, with a pleasantly chocolaty finish. Give it a couple more years of bottle age for optimal drinking."
"This rich and dense wine is maturing well. It has a solid texture, touches of dark chocolate as well as juicy blackberry flavors underlined by wood aging. The tannins need to soften further; drink from 2020."
"The inaugural release of this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (57%), Syrah (34%) and Malbec. The aromas pop with plum, cherry, herb and barrel spice notes. The palate is broad and incredibly pleasing."
"Although not a premier cru, this village wine has plenty of the firm tannins and sense of structure that give Pommard its reputation. The wood aging shows through in spice and toast while the wine has plenty of black-cherry fruit and acidity to allow it to age well. Drink this wine from 2020."
"This rich wine has beautifully integrated tannins and ripe fruit. With a generous character and succulent fruit over a base of firm tannins, it has excellent potential. Its tannins need to soften more for the wine to be ready to drink, so wait until 2023."
"This wine comes from a single vineyard site on a south/south-east facing slope. It is rich in everything that a Saint-Vran should have: ripe fruit, balanced acidity and a generous full texture. With acidity to match, this is developing into a fine wine. Drink from late 2018."
"Glimmers of dusty mineral on the nose amplify into an anchoring core of salt and stone throughout this delicately sweet kabinett. Light footed yet firmly balanced, it juxtaposes juicy white peach and grapefruit against invigorating hits of lime and salt. It's approachable already but should maintain its fresh, primary style well through 2022."
"This is a reserve-tier wine that blends in Cabernet Sauvignon from both Diamond Mountain and Mount Veeder, in addition to 8% Cabernet Franc (Mount Veeder) and 3% Merlot (Diamond Mountain). Made in a tiny amount, it speaks in rich rapturous tones of chocolate-raspberry truffle wrapped in coconut, oak and soft rounded tannin."
"This wine is youthfully coiled and shy, a full-bodied expansion of brawny root, tar and bark flavors. Mild in tannin and structure, it offers aromas of rose garden and lavender, with a tangerine-like lift of acidity."
"There's a touch of gamy meat alongside purple flowers and candied rosemary on the nose of this blend of 60% Grenache, 23% Syrah and 17% Mourvdre. It would be the perfect wine for any weekend table, with versatile and food-friendly flavors of violet, lilac, charred beef and tart purple fruits."
"Dusty mineral tones are delicate yet persistent in this invigorating off-dry Riesling. Crisp, tart green plum and apple flavors are racy and spry, accented by tingly lemon-lime acidity and a hint of spice. It's a refreshing wine to enjoy now through 2021."
"A dense luxurious nose introduces plummy chocolate mocha flavors in this soft well-integrated wine from the producer's estate vineyard. High-elevation grippiness defines the serious tannin profile, suggesting further time in bottle or time to develop in the glass."
"Full bodied and full flavored, this substantial wine combines intense fruit flavors with bold, buttery and spicy accents. It feels mouthfilling and rich but has enough good acidity for liveliness and balance. Fine print on the label says this is made from Albario, and it's a most unusual and enjoyable example of the Spanish varietal."
"Wet clay, squeezed lemon and lightly toasted pecan show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard located just south of Highway 246. There's ripeness to the lemon-juice-driven palate as well as a rounded cashew cream character. The acidity is striking, nearly piercing by the finish."
"Petit Verdot makes up the majority of this blend at 58%, joining 38% Zinfandel and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon. Powerfully ripe and rich, it offers integrated oak and tannin around a juicy core of raspberry, blueberry and blackberry, the mouthfeel luxurious and soft."
"Creamy and luxurious in nature, this wine tastes of caramel apple, baked pear and pineapple. With a depth of vanilla oak, it offers body and weight, with a bright hit of freshness on the lengthy finish."
"This wine is earthy in tobacco and forest tones, with a bright thread of acidity within its more robust tendencies. Graphite, sage, leather and pepper meet firm, supportive tannins and a toasted oak tone."
"This wine is lean and initially austere. With dominant tannins and great concentration, it is firm but has the fruit weight to match with the extracted texture, so the wine will age well. It needs time for that structure to soften. Drink from 2025."
"Not much Chardonnay is produced at this winery, which is a shame. This spicy, toasty, well-rounded effort is clean and fresh. It mixes grapefruit, green apple and white peach flavors with zippy acidity. Drink now through 2025."
"This wine has density and richness. With ripe berry fruits and generous tannins, it strikes a chord between fruitiness and richness. It is structured as well, allowing room for aging. Drink this wine from 2022."
"The red fruit on this Margaret River red takes a back seat to secondary characters like earth, meat, black olives, coffee and herbs. The palate is medium bodied, with well-structured tannins and more earthy, meaty, and herbal goodness. Drink now2024."
"This is a highly impressive wine that's 100% varietal and blissfully well-priced. Dusty blackberry cobbler comes first to mind, held in check by robust tannin and powerful structure. A wine that will appeal to Cabernet Sauvignon fans, it balances that power with a soft side embedded in peppery clove."
This wine's compact black cherry fruit carries some stemmy hints due to the inclusion of 30% whole clusters. It has substantial grip and is hard and tight at this young stage. Give it ample breathing and/or some extra years of bottle age.
"This is a structured, firm wine with a dry core of tannins, which bodes well for the future as the rich fruit comes slowly through the structure. It has weight and juicy potential. The wine comes from a walled vineyard wholly owned by the producer. Drink from 2021."
"Beeswax, paraffin, petrol and orange pith show on the light but resilient nose of this dessert wine. There's an intriguing ashy and Brie cheese rind quality to the smoky sip, where the honey and peach syrup sweetness is obvious but plays more to the background. This is quite dynamic."
"Buttery, rich and creamily lush, this wine is robust and in tropical and stone fruit flavor, with a side note of green olive that makes it intriguing and memorable."
"This bottling is the perfect introduction to the biodynamic wines of Brick House. It has generous herbal scents and flavors, which may account for its entry-level pricing. But its pretty cherry fruit, complex aromas, cola-like touches and textured tannins all reflect the same care and substance as the rest of the portfolio."
"With a breath of matchstick on entry, this wine is ultimately juicy and gritty in texture, with a persistent backbeat of toasty oak. Ripe apple and papaya mix well to offer a tropical creaminess."
"This wine is tough and extracted, with dark-chocolate flavors as well as tannins. Its hard outer shell is rescued by the ripe black-currant fruits of the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025."
"This wine is full of crisp fruit, perfumed wood and red-berry acidity. Perfumed Cabernet Franc gives extra complexity to the juicy Merlot to offer a balanced wine that will be ready from 2019"
"Aromas of cherry and baking spices pave the way for flavors of black fruit, pomegranate, anise and thyme. This inky, garnet-colored wine is soft at first sip, with tannins that intensify as fruit and spice flavors fill the mouth and continue into a spicy, dry finish."
"This is a pretty yet serious Riesling from a historic Barossa winery. Melon, peach, lime, wild mint, flowers and a hint of kerosene all flow onto a light, delicate palate, with well balanced acidity and an attractive, spicy finish."
"This wine's bold black fruit aromas are a touch clipped. Its saturated palate offers a massive mouthful of berry fruit and tannins and chocolate notes. On the finish, it's peppery, toasty and stout. Serve this always reliable Malbec blend with grilled beef in the Argentino style."
Baking spice and red-berry aromas follow over to the linear palate along with licorice and other oak-driven spices. Refined tannins provide polished support.
"This wine is quiet on the nose, but comes to life in its fistful of brawny, thick black fruit and gritty, leathery texture. A touch of black pepper and cinnamon play off each other on the long, resolved finish."
"Deftly handled, this wine sidesteps the variety's characteristic heat and bitterness. Instead, it's loaded with spicy, gin-like botanical highlights and juicy, fresh lime and citrus fruit."
"Little Chardonnay grows in Nuits-Saint-Georges but Les Bousselots has both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This is a rich wine with a core of tannins as well as rounded, ripe yellow fruits cut with attractive spice and acidity. Drink this wine from 2020."
"A well-structured wine, this is rich and smooth. Under this sheen, the wine offers a tight texture with minerality and zesty orange. These two elements make for a wine with both instant pleasure and richness and potential. Drink from late 2018."
"With small amounts of Syrah and Zinfandel, this Pinot swings for the fences in spicy raspberry, cherry and cardamom, with just a touch of mint nipping at its nose. Robust oak and a ripe body give it power and weight."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat is rich yet it well balanced. Its jammy berry aromas are creamy but also a touch reedy. On the palate, dark black fruit flavors show their herbal, peppery side. It finishes plush. Drink through 2021."
"The second vintage of this Dundee Hills-grown cuve from winemaker Dominique Mah is sharp and spicy on entry. That sharpness yields to tart cranberry, raspberry and cherry pie flavors, with streaks of stem and herb. Native yeast fermentation seems to have contributed extra texture. Tuck this away for another year or two before drinking."
"This deep red violet colored wine features aromas of plum, black cherry and violet. Velvety tannins provide a backdrop for a good mix of fruit and spice flavors that include black cherry, raspberry, vanilla and licorice. The long spicy finish wraps up with a burst of cranberry flavor."
"Part of a new reserve-level series from Goodfellow, this was made from 100% Durant Vineyard fruit, half fermented using whole clusters. It shows more fruit flavor than the winery's other 2015s, offering plum and cherry notes supported by refreshing acids. Orange peel, pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon accents keep the palate lively."
"Sourced primarily from calcerous soils in Rheinhessen's Spiegelberg vineyards, this dry Riesling offers surprising elegance for such a reasonably priced wine. There's a mineral richness to the palate that lends an expansive feel to plump white peach and tangerine flavors. The finish wraps up with precision. Drink now through 2020."
"Apples, wet stone and a little honey lead into a refreshing palate, with plenty of acidity and a hint of richness to tip the scales into balance. A pleasing apple finish makes you want to keep going back for more."
"Still in its infancy, Howard Park's blend of Cab from Mt. Barker in the cool climes of the Great Southern and the slightly warmer Margaret River region, has a generous nose of dark cherry, mocha, pencil lead, mint and oak spice. There's plush fruit and herbs on the palate but it's still very tightly wound and the oaky tannins are big and drying. Give this a few years to even begin to show its true colors. Drink 20202032."
"This wine is fermented in stainless steel and French oak. It's a big, brawny red, with plenty of black fruit, tobacco and leathery tannin around an intensely powerful core."
"This bright and spicy wine tones down the grape's propensity toward grassiness, showing instead peppery white melon fruit and a phenolic bite. Production has increased in recent years, making this rare Oregon example of this classic Loire Valley grape more widely available."
"Dusty tannins are at the center of this boldly ripe, brawny wine, which offers soft plush texture and a depth of rich plum. Dark chocolate waves are complemented by a savory twist of cigar box and pepper."
"This wine's well-ripened yellow and green fruit flavors come with fruit skin and herb notes. It's a sleek, stylish and medium bodied, showing a light touch of toast from aging in a mix of new and one-year-old French oak."
"This single vineyard wine is complex and ageworthy, with a fair bit of wet stone, copper penny, and salty minerality along with lemon, melon and some toasty oak characters. The acidity dominates on the palate at the momentthe oak is apparent toobut this wine is really just starting its life. Drink 20182027."
"Leeuwin's Prelude combines some of the region's characteristic Cabernet traits: currants and graphite, with floral and savory notes and a tangy, elegant mouthfeel. The tannins are silky smooth and the finish is long and fruity. Drink now2025."
"This is a ripe wine with good structure as well as generous fruit. It has acidity, tannins and a smoky aftertaste while emphasizing the rounded red fruits that will make it delicious in a few years. It comes from vines on the flat lands stretching out into the Sane Valley. Drink from 2019."
"A nose of plum, raspberry and toast sets the stage for flavors of strawberry, raspberry, vanilla and tomato leaf. This wine is full in the mouth, with slightly chalky tannins that are offset by an overall sense of softness and a refreshing finish."
"Red fruit aromas are at the fore in this wine, with pleasing raspberry and Red Vines notes, along with spice accents. The palate shows remarkable restraint, refinement and balance considering the warmth of the vintage, and its firm tannic core should allow it to evolve nicely for a few years in the cellar."
"This wine's soil, black cherry, herb and spice aromas are followed by elegantly styled fruit flavors that show pretty balance. Despite the warmth of the vintage, this one is all about elegance."
"This is an extracted, lightly woven together wine that's ethereal in style. Candied orange peel and strawberry-rhubarb mingle softly on the palate, as seasonings of Asian five spice and cola wander by."

"Clean and slightly restrained on the fresh and vibrant nose, this single vineyard expression shows lime syrup, citrus zest, wet stone and chalk aromas. There is great lime skin tension to the sip, where bright, lemony flavors meet with hints of guava and crushed slate."
"This wine's ripe blackberry and cassis aromas come with mild game and toast notes that lend a wild edge. Its grapey, saturated palate is a touch choppy and acidic, but the depth of fruit more than compensates. With its meaty, toasty black fruit flavors, it seems to grow even darker as it finishes."
"Thyme-laced pomegranate juice aromas, enhanced with baked earth, white pepper and tarragon, makes for an intriguing entry to this bottling. The texture is light and delicate, combining dried garden herbs and buoyant red-fruit flavors, and finishing on clove. This is an easy afternoon sipper."

"Creamy and textured, this lively wine shows a tasty mix of lime, peach and tropical fruit highlights, along with a light touch of vanilla. It was aged on the lees for seven months in 17% new French oak."
"Well-balanced, this coastal wine is deftly integrated in acidity and floral aromas of apple blossom. Its exotic flavor profile leans into quince, fig and classic Gravenstein apple."
"By Barossa standards, this Shiraz is on the elegant, lighter side. There's juicy cherry, blue fruit, beef jerky, BBQ smoke and a hint of herbal oak spice on the nose. The first sip bursts in your mouth like a firecracker, with more juicy fruit and a silky, plush texture. Fine tannins are smokey and savory. Drink now2025."

"From the eastern edges of the Napa Valley, this is a bright and effusive wine, balanced in red fruit. Small percentages of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot and Grenache Blanc are included. It was barrel-aged for 18 months in French oak, 25% of it new. The wood is integrated and the texture softly layered."
"All the secondary characters that come into play as a wine matures are really working for this Merlot. The fruit is heading into raisin territory; there're earthy, vineyard floor and horse saddle notes. The palate is silky and savory, although the oak is still a little obvious. Drink now with autumnal cuisine."
"A heavy application of charred oak might be too much for some, but if that's to your liking then you should enjoy this Garnacha's smoky, spicy nose. A stout, full-bodied palate is full of resiny oak with a balance of acid. Saturated, woody flavors of roasted berry fruits finish toasty and resiny. Drink through 2020."
"This is an exotic, elegant and restrained coastal wine, that is tart with lemon and lemongrass. Light and bright, its texture is fluffy and creamy, with a lingering hint of biscotti."
"This aromatic, elegant 2015 is better balanced than its predecessor, while adhering to a similar style. Cherry blossom and rose petal aromas mark the nose, and lean, tart red fruit defines the palate. Short aging in 30% new French oak has brought in a light dusting of cocoa. Drink 20182025."
"There's a rather extreme minerality in play on this old-vine bottling, with wet gravel, scree and crushed slate leading the nose alongside crushed carnations, rose petals and touch of dark-plum fruit. Muddy chalky clay tones carry that vibe into the sip, only allowing a slight berry flavor to rise above."

"Aromas of black cherry, raspberry and violet lead you into flavors of fresh cherry juice and black plum. This Hungarian red blend has grippy tannins and a pleasant tart-cherry finish."
"This exceptional vintage of Plowbuster is solidly built and packed with blackberry and cherry fruit. It has a sea salt chocolate component also, which adds both texture and flavor. This is not a keeper, but with its quality to price ratio, it's certainly a drinker."
"Drilling aromas of graphite and balsamic dark fruits open this intense, pulling blend of 50% Carignan, 25% Garnacha and 15% Merlot. Roaring berry, chocolate and pepper flavors get brushed aside by the tannic roughness of the finish. Give this plenty of air before pouring; drink through 2024."
"This wine is named after former Canoe Ridge Estate vineyard manager Mimi Nye. Its high toned, pretty pear, yellow apple and barrel spice aromas lead to crisp, focused, well-balanced fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It's a spot on example of this variety and style."
"One of the top wines from one of Margaret River's leading producers, Cullen's 2014 Kevin John is certainly opulent, but the full malolactic fermentation and eight months in new oak seem to be masking the beautiful, biodynamically farmed fruit. Notes of butterscotch, pineapple and melon rind lead into a rich, toasty, nutty palate, with balanced acidity to keep things fresh. Drink now2024."

"This single-vineyard wine shows considerable potential. It offers a touch of spice as well as open, ripe and full yellow fruits. With just the right amount of acidity and a tangy orange and lemon zest texture, it is maturing well. Drink from 2019."
"This is a blend of two well-regarded vineyards, Lucky Well and Silver Eagle, both farmed by Ulises Valdez. It casts a considerable shadow of brawn and beauty, balancing strawberry-puree flavors with an earthy undertone of forest pine. Big-boned, it alternates between richness and freshness."

"Still a baby and therefore rather shy in the glass, a few good swirls eek out aromas of cherry cola, sweet spice and dusty oak. The tannins are big but integrated, with vibrant acidity and herbal, medicinal flavors. This is a rich, powerful style, but give it time and watch it shine. Drink 20192032."
"This wine strikes a great balance between freshness and concentration. It smells clean and minerally, tastes crisp at first like lemon and jicama but also concentrated and layered in notes of rich pear and fig."
"A blend of fruit from both the Saar and the middle Mosel (vineyards surrounding Piesport and Bernkastel) this lovely value Riseling darts and dances on the palate with Margarita-like kicks of salt and lime. Just a shade off dry, its delicate sweetness lends balance to zesty acidity and a cool, mineral finish. This cuve is also labeled under the Gryphon Crest brand."
"There's a barnyard funk to this that some will love and some might squirm at, but there's also plenty of ripe strawberry fruit, chocolate, earth and smoke. The palate shows plenty of drying, savory tannins balanced by fresh acidity. Everything wraps up with an earthy, savory finish. Drink now."
"Give this Great Southern Cab some time in glass or decanter to open up, but once it does it reveals notes of cherry cola, cranberry, florals, black pepper and an earthy core. The palate is rich and riding a line between full and medium bodied. It's currently tightly wound, with savory oak tannins that should mellow out with time. Drink now2027."

"Hannah is a block selection from the upper portion of the Tualatin estate vineyard. Rich and rounded, it shows preserved strawberry, cherry compote and chocolate flavors. A full degree higher in alcohol than the 2014, it's just on the edge of showing some heat. But with its big, forward fruit, it's spot on for immediate enjoyment."
"This cuve underwent 100% whole cluster fermentation using natural yeast and spent 16 months in French oak, just 10% new. It's compact and a bit subdued, as though the flavors are in hiding.

"A numeric score on this wine is almost silly, as it's about as bizarre as wine gets. A shade of yellowish orange in the glass, this bottling shows aromas of vermouth, wood varnish, cherry and, yes, blood orange on the nose. The palate combines iron, sour peach, walnut oil and pine much like a Sherry. Fascinating, though not for the mainstream."
"Under the same ownership as Chteau Rauzan-Gassies in Margaux, this estate is in the north of Haut-Mdoc region. It is dense with solid tannins and black fruit. A touch of black coffee hints at toasty wood as well as some extraction that needs to soften. The wine has potential; drink from 2021."

"Fruit for this wine comes from the oldest vines in this appellation, planted in 1975. The aromas are reserved, recalling baking and barrel spices, along with herbal and medicinal notes. The black fruit flavors are deep and rich, seeming ever so slightly dried out. Tightly wound tannins provide support. Give it a couple years in bottle."
"Leather, cedar and juicy blackberry fruit combine with force in this expansive, concentrated wine. Chocolate toffee layers provide additional richness and complexity, as the finish ends smooth."
"The Pinot Noirs from this new project from Evening Land founders Larry Stone and Dominique Lafon are intellectually challenging and palate-stretching in their austerity. Evoking rhubarb and citrus on the nose, this wine emphasizes citrus on the palate, particularly grapefruit, along with refreshing minerality. Like all the winery's Pinots, it rewards extended aeration and your full attention."
"More mineral than fruit, this dry white is a fantastic value, expressing Riesling's most crystalline character. Tangerine and green apple flavors are crisp and concentrated, showered in streams of lime acidity and cool mineral sensations. Drink now through 2020."

"Merlot makes up just over half this wine, with the balance in Cabernet Franc (34%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (15%). The aromas are high toned out of the gate, leading with cigar box, cedar and herb notes. They're followed by plum and piercingly pure cherry scents that becomes more prominent over time. The palate has elegantly styled fruit flavors surrounded by tightly coiled tannins. It needs a couple years in bottle to come into its own but is a very pretty wine."
"Well structured and full of ripe fruit, this is already a very drinkable wine. But there is more to come and this wine will show great swathes of fruit, balanced tannins and acidity, and a rich character as it matures. To enjoy it at its peak, drink from 2020."

"On first taste, this wine shows mouth-puckering acidity. But after some time in glass it chills out and the flinty, toasty, mineral notes start to creep in. Flavors of white pepper, bruised apple and wet stone meld with a bit of textural weight to slightly balance all that acidity. Still very youthful, this wine is clearly in it for the long haul. Drink 20192027."

"Very light in color in the glass, this bottling shows fragrant touches of clean tropicality, including creamy cherimoya, light tuberose, refreshing apple blossoms and sliced Gala apples on the nose. There's a bountiful sizzle of acidity to the sip, where crisp pear and apple flavors meet with honeysuckle and Key lime spray."

It's a five-grape blend that includes 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and in a cold year like 2014, that translates to angular acidity and heavily herbal plum and berry flavors. Decanting or long airing can only help this rugged amalgam. Drink through 2025."

"There's plenty of complexity in this bargain wine. The nose leads with ripe blueberries, florals, mocha, wet earth, dates and sumac. It's plush and juicy on the palate, with silky tannins, a medium body and a long, tangy finish. Drink now."
"Cheeky labeling aside, this vivaciously zesty dry Riesling is an easy candidate for an everyday quaffer. Delicate peach and yellow plum contrast bold strikes of lemon and lime on the palate. The finish is long and refreshingly crisp. Drink now through 2019."
"Crisp and fresh on the nose, this bottling offers lime skin, lemon juice, crushed flint and graphite aromas. It's tightly wound and zippy on the palate, but with ample flavors of Asian pear flesh, grippy chalk and a Key lime twist."
Intense black plum and cherry perfume juxtapose savory tones of smoked nuts and wet earth in this fresh and fruity yet composed wine. Plump black fruit flavors are broad and rich but framed by brisk acidity and a trace of mineral complexity. A fantastic introduction to German Pinot that's surprisingly easy on the wallet.
"Dark garnet in color, this wine offers aromas of black cherry, vanilla and violet. It is smooth on the palate, with soft tannins and flavors of blackberry, cherry, vanilla, juniper, lilac and anise. The spicy finish is marked with a touch of tartness."
"At first, this high-altitude Chardonnay comes across as massively oaked, as if extracted from a wood pile. With time, it sheds its heavy oak blanket and shows secondary notes of spiced apple and melon. It's dominated by wood throughout, and if that's not your thing, this might not be for you. Full and generous, yet balanced; drink through 2020."
"Bramble fruit, charred meat, earth and dusty oak lead into a medium-bodied palate that's got plenty of chewy, drying tannins but also a good deal of acidity to back things up."
"The fruit flavors in this young wine are fresh and forward, suggesting raspberry and cherry over a mineral base. The nicely textured palate carries wet stone flavors along with the fruit, and a streak of cola adorns the finish."

"This lovely rosato has alluring aromas of red cherry, ripe raspberry and cake spice that follow over to the savory palate. Bright acidity provides balance while a hint of mineral adds depth."
"This big bold wine is highlighted in raspberry, vanilla and smoky oak. Its texture is velvety smooth and rounded, while the flavors boast black licorice, black juicy fruit and a foundation of graham cracker crust."
"Aromas on this wine suggest underbrush, dried Mediterranean brush and exotic spice, with balsamic notes. The rounded, full-bodied palate shows cherry, strawberry compote, star anise and the warmth of alcohol alongside fine-grained tannins."
"This will take a few years to start to show its potential. At the moment, it's shy. This shows cherry, blackberry, vanilla, cocoa powder, cedar and floral tones. It's tightly wound on the palate, with dusty tannins and balanced acidity. Drink 20202037."
"From Elk Cove's sister label, this incorporates a fair amount of estate fruit, and it's very well made for its everyday price. Deliciously fruity and vibrant, it's packed with apple, pear, nectarine and snappy grapefruit flavors. Drink over the next year or two, while it's at its freshest."
"Aromas of white rose, citrus and yellow stone fruit are front and center on this dry, vibrant white. The tangy palate doles out apricot, grapefruit and a saline note alongside crisp acidity that gives it a quenching close."
"Deep tawny gold in color, this full-bodied, fruit-powered beauty bursts with ripe peach and papaya flavors. Blended with 4% Pinot Blanc, it's fresh and delicious now, so don't wait."
"Racy acidity sends jolts of electricity through delicate white blossom, lemon and lime in this refreshing dry Riesling. While moderate in fruit concentration, it's sheer, cutting mouthfeel is invigorating. Drink now through 2019."

"Candied lemon peel, walnut, cashew and balsam aromas show on the rich nose of this bottling from a vineyard just east of the Pacific Ocean behind Cambria. The palate is viscous with flavors of lemon syrup and orange rind."
"This proprietary and undisclosed blend is tart, astringent and aromatic. Notes of raspberry jam, squeezed lemon and coffee syrup take center stage here. It spent 22 months in half new French oak, and it's ready to go."
"A delicious touch of honey in this otherwise dry wine gives extra richness to the generous texture with its gentle spice from wood aging and juicy acidity. Ripe but crisp, the wine will be ready from 2019."
"Luscious, sun-ripened blackberries and cherries are boldly concentrated in this easy drinking but elegantly composed Pinot Noir. Fresh acidity and fine-grained, pleasantly bitter tannins make it an approachable introduction to German Pinot with a gentle price tag. Drink now through 2020."
"Vibrant raspberry and white peach aromas introduce this perfumed Pinot Noir ros. While dry in style, it's juicy and thirst quenching. Subtle hints of herb and spice lend complexity. Drink now."
"This is a peppery, plummy wine with plenty of grip on the palate. Structured and meaty, it rides its ripeness with ease, showing a taste of vanilla soda on the finish. Mixed black grapes account for 25% of the whole and originate from vines planted around 1900."
"This blends 55% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, the grapes sourced from both Atlas Peak and Howell Mountain. Smoky barbecue char wraps around tart tangy red fruit and powerfully soft and supple tannin."
"Isolation Ridge has long been the darling single-vineyard wine of the Frankland River subregion of Great Southern, and the 2016 succeeds in upholding this reputation. Lemon curd, apple and delicate florals are wreathed in a prickly palate that comes with a lick of creamy weightiness and plenty of acidity. A highly mineral, wet-stone finish is the cherry on top. Drink now2032."
"Very light on the nose, this bottling from 37-year-old vines shows squeezed lemon wedge, chilled Asian pear, hints of jicama and white rose petals on the nose. The citrusy palate is driven by a grapefruit pith flavor and enhanced with a touch of chalk. The texture is compellingly grippy."
"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry and red currant meet with peppercorns and crushed oregano on the nose of this bottling of old-vine Zin from southern Santa Clara County. It's a lighter style on the palate, with bright red plums, crushed river rock and a good helping of herb flavors."
"This richly oaked selection from the high-elevation Adrianna Vineyard in Tupungato smells of berries, red currants and maple. It's angular on the palate, with acidity so high it's downright citric. Red berry, red plum and wood grain are the dominant flavors, and they're tarter than they are lush. Tannin is a noticeable element on its otherwise racy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2035."
"This is a juicy and full-bodied white, tightly woven in oak and butterscotch. Expansive on the palate, with a depth of apple pie and nutmeg, it offers a balance of fresh acidity that complements well."
"Threads of citrus, cherry, cola and chocolate weave through this tasty wine. It's medium bodied, focused and immediately accessible. The blend includes seven different clones of estate-grown fruit, and it was aged in French oak for 16 months."
"Made following the principles of biodynamic viticulture and with natural yeasts, this savory red opens with aromas of ripe strawberry, violet and chopped herb. The light-bodied, juicy palate doles out raspberry jam, clove and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2019."
"Like all the Cristom Pinot Noirs, this was made with native yeasts and a significant amount of whole clusters. Although three fifths new oak was used, it has had little affect on the aroma, with no noticeable toast or caramel accents. It's tight and minerally, with wild raspberry fruit and a steely frame."
"Hearty and rather complex aromas show on the nose of this bottling, including black cherry, vanilla, cocoa dust, hickory smoke and coconut. The palate is dominated by baking spice and gingerbread flavors, set against a blackberry and caramel backbone, but the impressive part is the chalky firm tannins that hold up the flavors quite nicely."
"This is a soft wine, smooth and full with apricots and melons. Toasty wood flavors are balanced by the ripe fruit, the rich texture and light minerality. This opulent wine needs only short aging. Drink from 2020."
"Packed with fruit, this young wine is already delicious. Acidity, crisp texture, zingy orange and lemon-peel flavors all contribute to a ripe, refreshing wine. It has the lift of the vintage, bright and full of fruitiness from start to finish."
"Spicy and rich, this generous, single-vineyard wine is full bodied, creamy and ripe. Yellow fruits are balanced by bright acidity and a tight mineral character. It is still structured, with wood aging flavors and a juicy crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2019."
"From one of the most familiar of the Santenay premier crus, this wine still has its structure and a dry core. Around that are red cherry fruits, juicy acidity and a light touch of wood. The wine is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2019."
"From the lower slope of Pommard, this richly fruity wine is smooth and generous. It has a layer of tannin as well as full black fruits and a solid character. The wine is still young and needs aging. Drink from 2020."
"Vintage dated and made in the classic Champagne method, this tasty brut is a pretty shade of copper-hued rose. It has lovely cherry fruit and ample length. Overall, a very tasty effort."
"This is a sanguine Old World-style wine, rounded in tannin and generously soft. Coconut, bay leaf, cherry and vanilla give it a yin and yang quality that flirts with both savory and rich flavors, finding balance despite its full-bodied concentration."
"This wine is light straw in color, with soft yet surprisingly persistent perlage. A nose of grapefruit and clementine leads the way for flavors of lemon, pineapple and grapefruit that fade into a soft brioche-flavored finish."
"A blend of fruit from both the Saar and the middle Mosel (vineyards surrounding Piesport and Bernkastel) this lovely value Riseling darts and dances on the palate with Margarita-like kicks of salt and lime. Just a shade off dry, its delicate sweetness lends balance to zesty acidity and a cool, mineral finish. This cuve is also labeled under the Hooked brand."
"A blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 1% Merlot, this is a hearty sanguine red wine, with highlights of eucalyptus, peppercorn and billowy tobacco-laden tannin. Well integrated, it shows plenty of oak and inky concentration."
"This is a floral wine, ripe and creamy. It has spice and toast from wood aging along with good acidity and impressiver richness. The wine is full-bodied, spicy, full of yellow and pear fruits. Drink from 2019"
"In this vintage, the wine itself is as catchy as Mar de Frades's signature blue bottle. Aromas of green melon, apple and lees are spot on for the variety. Flavors of pineapple and citrus finish with modest complexity carried by the presence of lees."
"This wine's blackberry, maple and creamy oak aromas introduce a tough but deep palate that's loaded with fruit and tannins. Its wild berry and plum flavors are raw, finishing with cheek-drying astringency. Give it lots of air upon opening and serve with meat or pasta. Drink through 2021."
"Rugged licorice and black fruit aromas include a note of barnyard animal in this wine. How tolerable the palate is depends on your ability to process rock-hard tannins. Its blackened berry and toast flavors are compact, feeling rough and heavily toasted through the finish. Drink through 2025."
"There is plenty of crisp acidity in this wine, with bright red fruits that come through the tannins. That makes for a juicy, firm wine, crisp and with a dry core. It will be ready to drink from 2024."
"Very light aromas of pomegranate, vanilla dust and sweet pastry show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are also quite subtle, with red currants, a touch of bitter cranberry and dried garden herbs."
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (37%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), Merlot (15%), Malbec (9%) and Petit Verdot. Its aromas are still locked up, including its cinnamon, cedar and nutmeg notes and its brooding dark fruit. The palate packs a mouthful of black fruit flavors that show the ripeness of the vintage yet retain a sense of balance."
"Made with 35% Corvina, 35% Corvinone, 23% Rondinella and 7% Oseleta, this opens with aromas of blackberry, graphite and a touch of cedar. The concentrated, savory palate delivers red plum, carob, white pepper and a hint of rhubarb alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2023."
"Electric acidity lends vitality to this zesty and refreshing dry Riesling. Pristine white grapefruit and tangerine flavors are cutting and spry on the palate, lingering on an edge of salty minerality. Enjoy now for its exuberant freshness, but it should show brightly through 2020."
"This is an impressive wine at the price point, sanguine and meaty, with medium-bodied density and highlights of cassis. Bright and well integrated, it's food friendly and ready to please a crowd."
"After 18 months in barrel (75% new), this was the last of the winery's 2014 Pinot Noirs to be released. The color is dark and vibrant, and it opens with orange peel, berry, spiced cherry and smoke notes. The expected barrel flavors are hiding, and the wine seems to dissipate rather quickly. It warrants another couple of years in bottle before drinking."
"Light in the glass, this bottling is a decent example of a more restrained Santa Lucia Highlands wine, with aromas of crisp raspberry, hibiscus and cranberry notes alongside warming hints of vanilla and thyme. Fresh and lively flavors of tart red fruits are dusted by herbs and spice cake on the palate."
"This wine has density and richness. With ripe berry fruits and generous tannins it conveys the fruitiness and richness of a Gevrey-Chambertin. It is structured as well, allowing plenty of room for aging. Drink this wine from 2022."
"You can taste a bit of all of the varieties in this Bordeaux-style red blend. This shows red currant and raspberry notes, smoked meat, coffee, cigar box and some dusty oak. The palate is medium to full bodied, with more tangy red fruit and cigar box spice. Tight yet silky tannins wrap up this powerful yet easygoing red."
"This blend is made from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah and 15% Merlot. It works in its dusty bramble of succulent black cherry and licorice, ultimately presenting a satisfying, likable wine that's full bodied and richly round."
"Mountain-like tannins make for a robust, powerful and concentrated palate that shows a leathery texture. Sage, black pepper and black currant spice up richer elements of dark chocolate and caramelized oak."
"When Cobos gets its heavyweight Malbecs right, they're some of the best in Argentina. But in a year like 2014, when the end of the vintage was cold and rain-plagued, many of the big wines seem stunted. With its fully oaked mint, smoke and spice aromas, this delivers nothing but power. Toasted flavors of blackberry, cassis and raisin mark the hard palate, finishing short and with some heat. Age this until 2020 for best results."
"Made with 90% Nerello Mascalese and 10% Nerello Cappuccio, this has aromas suggesting scorched earth, brimstone, charcuterie and dried Mediterranean herb. On the linear palate, hints of licorice, clove and a smoky note accent a core of dried black cherry. Fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2022."
"A blast of chocolate and mocha rises up on this heavily oaked Monastrell and Cabernet blend before those aromas change to char and toast. A chewy, heavyweight palate deals flavors of licorice, blackened oak and char along with dark fruit that's more canvas than paint. Drink this modern red with steak or roast lamb and it will show best."
"This is a delicate, light Chardonnay with age is on its side. Ripe red apples, melon, vanilla and some toasty oak aromas lead into a more floral and citrus palate. There's a good lick of acidity but it's relatively in balance with some textural weight. Still tightly wound, there're plenty more years left. Drink now2027."
"Glazes of honey and caramelized sugar lend sweetness to unctuous guava and white peach throughout this fruity, forward sptlese. Racy lemon-lime acidity lends keen balance on the palate, extending a citrusy freshness to the finish. Drink now through 2025."
"The AVA Series comprises small-production, single vineyard wines that showcase specific Willamette Valley terroirs. This one, sourced from the outstanding Alloro vineyard, is a delicious mix of red fruit, charred wood, caramel and sea salt. The 30% new oak is right up fronttoasty and quite tasty."
"Dry as indicated, with substantial alcohol for a Riesling, this is a tart and juicy explosion of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and pineapple fruit. There's a succulent snap to the finish, which ties in just a hint of residual sugar to round it off a touch."
"Cherry chocolate cake, mint, and beef jerky make up the primary aromas on this red blend from one of Margaret River's top producers. The palate is medium bodied, with dusty, drying yet elegant tannins and a salt and cherry finish. Drink now."
"Meaty blackberry aromas smell of soy sauce and game. A widespread palate comes with grabby tannins. Mint, oak and herbal berry fruit flavors are more sauvage than polished, while this blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Petit Verdot is tight on the finish, with rugged residual tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Altocedro likes to pile on the creamy oak, and this Malbec has that in spades. Wood spice and lacquer aromas weigh down its blueberry, blackberry and green scents. Chunky weight and creamy oak define the palate, as do burnt wood, resin and grassy berry flavors."
"This spicy, fiery smelling Garnacha shows bright plum and berry aromas. In the mouth, this is tough and tannic, with raw acidity and a mild burn. Dark, spicy berry flavors are blackened, while this tastes peppery and feels hot on the finish."
"This pleasant wine is aging rather quickly, already a light rose hue with early bricking. It's in its prime drinking window, with sour cherry and plum flavors and hints of stem and bitter herb, all in proportion. Drink now through 2022."
"From the oldest section of the estate vineyard, this offers rounded strawberry and Bing cherry flavors. It's appealing, though not quite as interesting as some of the other 2015s, and should be enjoyed within five years of the vintage."
"This toasty, tasty wine balances its apple, peach and banana fruit with barrel flavors and sweet toast scents. It was barrel aged for 15 months in 20% new oak."
"From vines that lie behind the main Cte de Nuits, this rich wine shows how even the cooler vineyards have made sumptuous wines in 2015. The wine is soft, gently tannic with plenty of red fruits. It is likely to develop quickly and will be ready to drink from 2019."
"This bold, rich wine is full of fruit while also having a tight texture that will allow it to age. It comes from a blend of different parcels that together give a precise and nuanced picture of Saint-Vran. With its edge of minerality, this wine should age, so drink from late 2018."
"The Maladire vineyard has given a structured wine full of dark tannins and concentrated black fruit. With acidity to match and a dry core, it is a rich wine with considerable potential. Drink from 2022."

"This reserve level Iris Vineyards wine gets a special name and faux wax capsule, along with time in new oak. It's then blended and aged in a neutral puncheon, making it soft and easy-drinking, its spicy pear and peach fruit swathed in a light mix of butter, caramel and toast. Give it a slight chill and drink now through 2021."
"This soft, creamy wine comes from old vines close to the Brocard winery. It has the proper crispness and citrus character of the vintage plus riper yellow fruits and melon. Drink this attractive wine from late 2018."
"Fresh lemon and bramble notes on the nose open to plush white peach and honey in this straightforward yet irresistible auslese. This is both ample in fruit yet briskly balanced. The finish is long and sweet, edged by a hint of caramel."
"Thick and dusty in cedar and a touch of smoke, this robustly ripe wine leans into thickets of brambly black currant and blackberry dipped in chocolate."
This village wine comes from a number of growers who supply Jadot on a regular basis. It is bold and ripe with citrus and white stone fruits as well as plenty of acidity. Its rounded character will show more strongly as it ages. Drink from 2020.
"The vines of Ladoix are at the base of the Corton hill but much less well known and therefore better value. Juicy acidity and the core of tannin suggest a wine that is ageworthy, while the black-plum fruits give richness now. Drink from 2019."
"This is a well-balanced wine with crisp acidity, steely texture and delicious citrus fruits. It has a bright, lively texture and will be ready to drink from summer 2018."
"The nose on this sleek bottling by Doug Margerum manages to combines both the grape's telltale grassy tones and tightly reductive qualities with fresh passion fruit and kiwi flavors. There is a great sizzle of acidity to the sip, where lime skin and white rock flavors shine."

"Crisp and steely, this wine tastes absolutely fresh from the light herb and green-apple aroma to the lemon-lime flavors, lively acidity and clean snappy finish. It's light to medium in body, has good balance and an especially appetizing character."
"This reserve-level wine was assembled from barrels representing six different vineyards. It's aromatic, with berry and cherry scents that carry into the midpalate. It was aged for 10 months in 40% new oak. Cellaring for another year would certainly be advised."
"This wine's cherry fruit is framed by aggressive phenolic notes. They bring a definite bite to the flavors, and the tannins remain stiff and rather hard. Additional bottle age and/or aggressive aeration are recommended, as the wine improved significantly after being open for a full day."
This deliciously rich and ripe wine is full of generous fruits with great depth of flavor. The concentration and the warm white fruits are intense with acidity and crispness. This is a wine to age a little longer. Drink from 2019.
"This barrel-fermented Tempranillo Blanco is low in intensity on the nose. However, in the mouth it is linear and shows strong acidity. Oxidized, old-school flavors of dry white fruits and oak finish long and mellow. Drink this classic white Rioja through 2020."
"A dark shade of rusty pink, this bottling shows red cherry, wet stone, muddy loam and baking spice on the unique and dynamic nose. Cherries shine on the sip as do clove, fennel and baked good flavors. Rather complex for a pink wine."
"Bright lemon and orange rind aromas meet with sea salt, nectarine and a yellow grapefruit pith on the nose of this bottling by Karen Steinwachs. Tightly wound on the palate, this single-vineyard expression shows fresh and lively flavors of citrus pith, yogurt and Brie rind. Could use a bit more time in bottle to fully shine."
"Aromas of apple and freshly cut Bartlett pear carry the nose, while flavors of white peach and pear juice mark the crisp palate. Bracing minerality and a slightly astringent finish help maintain balance."

"Opaque in color, this wine is dense in blackberry, dark chocolate, cola and vanillin oak aromas. A hot, full-bodied palate is full of plush dark fruit and more oak. This is a powerful, ultra rich red that's seen a lot of sunshine. Drink 20192037."
"Co-fermentation with 10% Marsanne has added flesh and white peach flavors to the green fruit of this Vermentino. Despite its youth, it's smooth and well-integrated, with a touch of vanilla cream on the finish."
"This is a single-vineyard wine, although not a Premier Cru. It is ripe with plenty of strawberry fruit. Still young though, it is also filled with tannins and tight, juicy acidity that need to soften into the fruits. The wine is potentially warm and ripe. Drink from 2021."
"All the white wines from this budget-friendly label managed by Joe Dobbes are simply excellent values. In this new vintage, the Pinot Blanc stands out for its tart, racy mix of citrus, apple and white peach fruit. It's exactly the sort of white to drink on a weeknight with a simple pasta or chicken dish."

"There's no mistaking the variety in this wine, with its lychee and white flower aromas. The palate is dry and broad in feel, with bitter notes on the finish."
"This is designated as a reserve-level cuve, and its dark fruit and overall ripeness confirm that ambition. A smoky, earthy component adds depth, and the tannins remain quite astringent. Blood orange and black raspberry flavors stand out at first but fade quickly on the palate. A subtler wine than the previous vintage."
"From Dominio de Atauta, this crianza is slightly murky and earthy up front, with aromas of smoky wood, prune and dark grit. A full, saturated palate is packed with power, while this tastes of blackberry, prune and leather."
"The tannins are strong and firm in this wine. Its dense texture and concentration are balanced by crisp red-currant fruit. There is freshness as well from the acidity, giving a crisp aftertaste to this fruity wine. Drink from 2024."
"Firm acidity and a sour cherry flavor make this medium-bodied wine very palate-cleansing. It emphasizes liveliness and a light tannic grip over pure fruitiness, but it still delivers complex and attractive cherry and rhubarb flavors."

"A trace of savory earth tones lend contrast to lively green plum, lime and gooseberry notes in this slightly off-dry Riesling. Light-footed and frisky, it's a refreshing, spry wine to enjoy now through 2019."
"This wine's reduced, rubbery aromas take a long time to come around. It's tight as nails and hard as a rock. Its narrow flavor profile includes toast and herbal plum and cassis notes that never fully unwind. Drink this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend through 2025."
"From the home vineyard of the Larochette family, this wine has some structure as well as great fruit. It is dense, full of rich white stone fruits, touches of vanilla and a terrific juiciness that conveys succulence. Drink the wine from late 2018."
"Dried blueberries and plums, leather, tobacco, tar and baked goods show on the nose of this bottling, which is enhanced by 15% Petite Sirah and 10% Monastrell. The palate also shows a somewhat dried character of blueberry and Concord grape, with a touch of tar, framed by decent structure and fine acidity."
"The nose of this wine brings forth characters of soap, slightly sweet oak, red and black cherries and potpourri. The medium-bodied palate is more promising: The fruit is brambly and there's an earthy core that comes into play. Tightly wound tannins meld with plentiful acidity, indicating that there's more life left in this wine yet. Drink now2027."
"Maximum ripeness is conveyed through concentrated berry aromas. On the palate, that same ripeness includes blazing tartaric acidity that creates a scratchy mouthfeel. Blasting raisin, cassis and berry flavors see screechy acidity take over on the finish, with oaky flavor remnants. This is equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot"
"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot has aromas of black plum, graphite and black raspberry. Flavors of brown baking spices, black plum, and black raspberry meld with velvet mouthfeel. The tannins are smooth and the finish is persistent."
"This wine's inviting cherry pie aromas come with chicory, burnt sugar and smoke overtones. The tannins are drying, but the flavor and power are greater than the price tag would suggest."
"Hailing from Istria, this Croatian Merlot has aromas of blackberry, raspberry and red plum. In the mouth there are flavors of red plum and black cherry with a persistent finish."
"Toasty aromas lead to a wine that has obviously had plenty of wood aging. That shows in this cooler vintage and dominates the red fruits. Of course, the fruit will fill out and there is plenty of weight there. It will be worth waiting at least until 2020 to drink."
"A clover aromas leads on the nose, with white flower accents in the background. A round, healthy palate is mildly citric, with an orange note running strong. A steady finish helps this conclude well. Drink now."
"Vigorous swirling and time in glass eventually eked out bramble fruit characters with florals, baking spices and vanilla oak notes. The palate is shy and tightly wound at the moment but everything is in balance. Drink 20192032."
"Aromas of white peach, white flowers and green apple prepare your palate for bright fruit flavors of ripe apple and yellow peach. This wine is well balanced, with a crisp and clean finish."

This is drinkable now with some time in decanter but will best express itself with over the next few years."
"Bigger and richer than some of its Western Australian counterparts, this Shiraz has some age on it and is showing it with notes of raw meat, Dr. Pepper, red currant and earthy funk.

"Light in color, this bottling shows lemon rinds, orange blossoms, lime zest, wet concrete and the slightest hint of petrol on the nose. The flavors are very rounded and botanical in nature, with gin-like touches of lime skin, apple blossom and a sweet juniper touch. It offers great tension and acid."

"Grapey black fruit aromas come with notes of clay and violets in this Malbec blend. On the palate, strong acid and tannins form a barrier wall. Its high-toned plum, currant and wild berry flavors come with gritty tannins that persist on the finish. With food, especially Argentinian asado, this won't go wrong."
"Part of a new reserve-level series from single vineyard blocks, this wine was made from 100% Fir Crest Vineyard fruit that was fermented using 75% whole clusters and aged in 50% new oak. Despite all the care and attention, it shows little besides very tart raspberry fruit and a high-acid finish."

"Freshly pressed raspberries and boysenberries meet with cherry syrup, baking spice and distilled rosewater on the nose of this bottling, which is interesting if not particularly Cab Franc-like.

"From one of the state's top sites, this shows lees, biscuit and apple aromas at the fore. The palate brings light, lemony flavors, with a red apple-filled finish. There are some interesting things going on here, but they don't quite all come together, though the acidity is notable considering the warm vintage."
"This blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Malbec has ripe, raisiny aromas, with some greenness on the nose. It's rough, acidic and tartaric in feel, with plum and prune flavors that grow oaky and peppery as it unwinds, with light grassy hints on the finish."

"Here's an affordable, off-dry (18 g/L residual sugar) wine with a friendly mix of citrus and lemon tea notes. The sweetness lends a sugary, rock candy-like mouthfeel, and the dominant fruit flavor is orange."

"Saint-Romain is one of the villages in the hills behind the main Cte de Beaune vineyards. As such it produces a cooler style of wine with crisp red-berry and red-currant fruitiness. There is a tang to its texture as well as a layer of tannins. Drink this potentially lively, fruity wine from 2019."

"This wine is a blend of 55% Viognier, 23% Grenache Blanc and 22% Roussanne. Its light apple, vanilla, citrus and spice aromas are followed by creamy, thick-feeling fruit flavors that persist on the spice-filled finish. It comes off quite heavy."

"This combines old vine plantings of Pommard, Coury and 667 clones, showing some extra refinement among its mixed fruit flavors. You'll pick out lemon, orange, berry and cherry, but as with the winery's other Pinots, the acids are jagged and chalky and detract from the finish."

Its texture is still young and tight although it will open up as it matures over the next few months, until mid-2018. At that time, enjoy the richness and the ripe white stone-fruit flavors."

"Rich and full of ripe fruit, this is a generous wine. Apricot and peach flavors are right up front, with great fruitiness as well as a tang of minerality. It is an opulent wine, full bodied and ready to drink."
"Still closed and tight, this mineral-textured wine has acidity, a crisp texture and citrus flavors. Fruity now, it will show even more in the future. The wine needs to age, drink from 2020."
"Peachy and plush, this intensely aromatic, concentrated wine offers loads of juicy, forward stone fruit and citrus flavors. Light-bodied, spry and subtly sweet, it's a widely appealing choice at a remarkable price. Drink now."
"With small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this is a reduced and juicy wine, showy in notes of oak and cinnamon. Juicy plum and black cherry provide concentrated fruit flavors alongside a richness of milk chocolate."
This wine made from a mix of clones is front-loaded with cinnamon and other baking spice accents. There's a broad streak of root beer followed by suggestions of pepper and green herbs.
"Clean if rather ripe aromas of peach, bubblegum and banana show on the nose of this bottling, which displays expert restraint from a warm region for an often blousy variety. There's a rich custardy touch at first on the sip, with plumeria and guava flavors, but then the chalky texture reins it back."
"Juicy tangerine, lemon and lime abound on this dry, light-bodied Riesling, but earthy, savory herb and mineral notes are prominent as well. It's a brisk, refreshing wine, with a lean, steely finish. Drink now through 2019."
"Despite being a full four years old, this wine's aromas aren't yet fully revealing their charms, with high-toned vanilla, spice, cedar and cherry notes. The flavors are tightly wound as well, with a light gamy streak throughout. It's not clear if it will open with additional time or if what you see is what you get."
"Blended with 20% Syrah, this brooding wine shows butterscotch, red fruit and spice aromas and tart, high-acid fruit flavors. It's a mix of fruit and barrel characteristics, even though the oak used was neutral. The tannins bring a lightly chalky feel."
"This wine's aromas are upfront, with green pepper, jalapeo and herb notes. The palate is full of dark cherry and herb flavors that show pleasing balance. It's not for all tastes but is sure to please those who enjoy this variety's greener side."
"This immediately attractive and fruity wine takes its name from the church next to the winery. It is soft with ripe white fruits that are cut by citrus, spice and vanilla flavors. Open and easy, it will be ready to drink from late 2018."
"Principally Merlot (45%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Syrah (19%), along with other red varieties, this brings apple, cherry and barrel spice aromas. The flavors are full bodied and liquorous, providing some appeal."
"This wine's aromas are quite reticent, making one strain to perceive what's in the glass. The palate provides a stark contrast, with bold, lush dark fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. It's a full-bore interpretation of the variety that could move up a notch if the aromas open up."
"Relatively light and delicate on the nose, this bottling shows chalk, ripe pear and the unmistakable aroma of banana-flavored Now & Laters candy. The palate is tightly wound yet tropical, with papaya, mango and ripe peach flavors, each more expressive as the wine warms."
"A ripe and rounded wine, this is rich and full of warm apricot and peach flavors. With refreshing acidity as a contrast, the wine is generous, hinting at spice and vanilla and ready to drink."
"Tight tannins proclaim the youth of this wine. With those firm tannins and a dry, solid character, the wine is not yet showing its fruit. Just a hint from the weight of the wine suggests red-cherry flavors will develop. Drink from 2023."
"This shows exuberant boysenberry, violet, herb, smoked meat and peppery spice aromas, along with a slightly distracting tire rubber note. The palate is packed tightly with rich flavors that carry through the fruit-filled finish. If the tire rubber aromas resolve, it will greatly improve."
"This is aged entirely in French oak, 75% of it new. Grippy structure surrounds a softened sensibility of dark cherry and chocolate, the oak smoky and tinged in vanilla."
"Red-skinned berry, nutmeg and violet aromas waft out of the glass. Light bodied and savory, it offers red currant, clove and a touch of licorice alongside fresh acidity and rounded tannins. Enjoy soon."
"Aromas of vanilla, baking spice and a hint of black-skinned berry lead the nose while the straightforward palate delivers tobacco, black cherry and a touch of fresh mint. Firm tannins provide support."
"This is a 100% varietal wine, leathery and earthy in approach and style. Full bodied and extracted in bold brawny black fruit, it offers accents of pencil and wax."
"Earthy, lightly baked berry aromas fresh on the nose. A snappy palate with raw acidity leads to mildly herbal plum and berry flavors. A dry, spicy, nicely oaked finish is a bit choppy in feel but tastes right. Similar to past bottlings, this is 55% Tempranillo, 30% Cab Sauvignon and 15% Merlot."
"Brown sugar, flower, pineapple and sugared peach aromas lead to sweet, elegant fruit flavors in this wine. There's some intrigue, but it doesn't all come together."
Unusual scents of brimstone and smoke combine with Mediterranean brush and ripe citrus zest. The aromas carry over to the palate along with a saline note and bright acidity.
"This pink wine shows plump white peach, watermelon, wet cement and a twist of lime on the nose. There's a flash of sweetness on the sip, with ripe melons, but then it dries up, highlighting rosewater and soft pink-fruit flavors."
"Production of this cuve has increased dramatically under the winery's new ownership, making it widely available. It's smooth and balanced, with mixed red fruit flavors cut with an herbal edge. The finish is tart and tight, calling for a hearty decant before serving."
"With the addition of 14% Petite Sirah, this delightful old-vine wine is lightly spiced with a taste of black licorice. Vanilla, blackberry and white chocolate add layers of complex, welcomed flavor and succulence to the full-bodied whole."
"This full-bodied blend combines a majority of Merlot with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Tannic and tight-grained, it's rustic in leather, black cherry and tart soy."
"Black-fruit aromas with accents of road tar and spice turn more herbal with airing. A tight, crisp mouthfeel is built around smacking acidity, while plum and berry flavors come with peppery spice notes. An herbal character returns on a ripped, juicy finish. Drink through 2021."
"Long a staple of the Silvan Ridge lineup, this lightly fizzy Muscat is off-dry, fresh and aromatic, with orange candy scents and flavors. Serve it as an apritif with soft cheeses or use it to spiff up your Sunday mimosas or Bellinis."
"Aromas of baking spice and black-skinned berry lead the way. The straightforward palate offers vanilla, black-cherry jam and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2021."
"Though designated a reserve, nothing really sets this apart from other Spindrift Pinot Noirs, other than a slight increase in price. Black cherry fruit, a streak of cola, and a suggestion of cold coffee come through. It's drinking well and should be consumed over the near term."
"This wine has a throwback label celebrating Chateau Ste Michelle's 50th anniversary. Upfront aromas of clarified butter, peach and spice are followed by medium-bodied stone fruit flavors. It's a varietal crowd-pleaser."
"Aromas of red plum, baking spice and white pepper set the tone while the savory palate delivers raspberry jam, clove and tobacco. It's already accessible and easygoing, with polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
"Aromas of ripe black-skinned berry, tilled soil and cooking spice lead the way while the dense palate evokes prune, cocoa and a touch of cinnamon. Supple tannins provide the lithe framework."
"Zesty lemon-lime acidity and succulent peach and pineapple flavors collide in this easy-sipping, off-dry Riesling. Light-footed and fruity, it's not a complex wine but widely appealing. Drink now."
"This wine's dark, rooty black fruit aromas are more cool and earthy than bright. In the mouth, it's dense and sort of flat. That theme is echoed in its flavors, which recall prune, chocolate and mocha. It finishes with heavy berry notes and not many subtleties."
"This is a tart lively wine complex in forest floor, black tea and tangy flavors of cranberry, rhubarb and strawberry. It retains a medium-bodied weight that gives it breadth."
"From grapes grown in Carneros and Oak Knoll, this wine combines nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Tart and tannic, it offers structure and a lightness of oak around old-school elements of red currant and cedar."
"Earth and herbal notes fade with aeration, exposing prettier notes of honeydew, grapefruit and peach. Brisk acidity and plump, juicy stone-fruit notes lengthen a fresh, honey-glazed finish. Drink now."
"This is a toasty, smokey, nutty and slightly peachy Chardonnay from Margaret River. The palate is rich, with a viscous texture and balanced acidity, but the oak is a little prominent on the finish."
"This wine bursts with mango, peach and passionfruit, with a touch of cut grass. There's plenty of tongue-tingling acidity on the palate and some textural weight, likely from the Smillon."
"This wine's edgy, feral berry aromas are accented with clove and mint. Its tight, choppy palate is saturated with plum and baked berry flavors and a mild green note of mint. It holds onto that herbal quality on the finish."
"This wine's aromas are light but intriguing, with peat, cigar box, herb, flower and game notes. Its cherry and raspberry flavors are fresh and transparent, showing little apparent new oak influence. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
"This is a bright and expansive wine, brick in color, with aromas and flavors of bread, black cherry and leather. Grippy and powerful, it has a whiff of violet and plenty of length on the finish."
"This is a very cerebral wine that will be too bizarre for many. The blend of 55% Grenache, 23% Mourvdre, 10% Roussanne, 7% Cinsaut, 3% Carignane and 2% Grenache Blanc was allowed to sit in glass tanks in front of the sun for nine months, which gives the resulting wine a Sherry-like qualities: yellow-orange in color, with aromas and flavors of smoked walnuts, sour oranges, beeswax, honey and wood oil."
"The best of the winery's current release white wines, this offers fresh and well-defined apple and tart melon flavors. It seems to have spent some time in barrel, but the acidity balances the oak flavors well."
"Melon aromas of honeydew and cantaloupe meet with crisp stone fruit and Key lime pie on the nose of this bottling. There is a chalky grip to the sip, with mellow flavors of Meyer lemon juice and Asian pear."
"Opening aromas convey raisin, cocoa, a hint of bell pepper and earthy whiff of game. The firm palate shows fig, cassis and dried sage alongside tightly wound tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Dried rose petals, concentrated red cherry, anise, thyme and caramel show on the nose of this blend of Tempranillo, Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. The palate is dominated by a rustic sagebrush quality, with earthy red berry and crushed slate adding pleasant complexity."
"Run by the sixth generation of the Belland family, this estate has vines in Santenay and other Cte de Beaune appellations. This wine, rich with generous red cherry fruits, is lightly tannic with great swathes of acidity and fruitiness. Drink from 2019."
"Full-blast mocha, blackberry and cassis aromas announce a fruity, extracted red. Its pulpy palate has bold, candied black fruit flavors that end rather quickly."
"Dry red berry aromas and spicy oak notes make for a good opening in this wine. It's a bit creamy in texture, with commendable overall balance. It offers ripe raspberry and cassis flavors, with a touch of milk chocolate on the smooth finish."
"Thick and moderate in structure, this wine is fleshy, lush and tropical in nature. Swirled in butterscotch, vanilla and caramel, the oak is toasty and supportive."
"This is fresh and lively, with apple and pear fruit flavors. It's simple, clean and enjoyable, with a light dusting of cinnamon spice. The vineyard sources included Rickreall Estate and Erratic Oaks."
"More steely than the Isolation Ridge, the nose offers plenty of floral notes combined with pineapple, stone fruit, apple and yeast. This leads into a tightly wound yet fruity palate, with crushed stone and a poise and structure that sets this up for plenty of years of cellaring. Drink 20192032."
"Intensely perfumed, this wine is full of peachy soap and potpourri, along with passionfruit notes and a hint of spice. The bombastic fruit and floral notes continue on the palate which is balanced and light bodied. Drink now."
"Sunny tangerines and lemons abound in this full-bodied dry Pinot Gris. Yielding acidity and plump fruit amplifies its rich, rolling mouthfeel. While moderately concentrated on the palate, it's a pleasant, easygoing sip with wide appeal."
"A recent addition to the winery's single vineyard offerings, this has a strongly acidic profile, but the fruit suggests cherry rather than leaner berry flavors. The tannins are stiff and astringenta result of 50% whole cluster fermentation."
"This wine's aroma brings notes of vanilla, woodspice and baking spice in addition to its bright tangerine scents. The palate is elegant yet creamy in feel, with stone fruit and barrel flavors throughout. It pulls up a bit short on the finish but is otherwise a lovely wine."
"This wine was sourced from Clos CheValle Vineyard. It shows primary fruit aromas that bring a lightly candied quality and herbal accents. The palate is a bit clunky, losing some of the variety's delicacy but still delivering enjoyment."
"Very shy at first, this wine eventually shows dark raisiny fruit, vanilla and toasty oak. There's plenty of richness and heat, that meld with grainy, tightly wound tannins and plush fruit."
"Ripe stone fruit, lemon-lime popsicle and blossoms lead into a palate of crisp acidity. Acid hounds will dig this fairly simple but likable drop."
"Medium gold in color, this wine has aromas of pear and talc. It is slightly off-dry, offering flavors of pear, gala apple, toffee and apricot, with a soft mouthfeel and a light, floral finish."
"This wine's vanilla and herb aromas are high toned. The palate brings abundant fruit and barrel flavors, with lively acidity providing the frame. The tannins seem a little coarse at present. Give them some time to settle."
"This wine is well balanced, with ripe apricot and peach fruits that contrast with the crisp, tangy lemon. Together they give a wine that is juicy and bright while also full bodied and rich. Drink from 2018."
Aromas of rose petals and raisins carry to a compact palate that is chewy and tannic. Blocky plum and berry flavors are slightly flat on a finish with scraping tannins. Drink through 2021.
This 100% varietal wine shows high-toned baking spice and red fruit aromas that lead to ripe but well-proportioned cherry and meat flavors. Fruit and barrel notes interweave on the finish.
"This Moldovan Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of smoked meats and black fruits. In the mouth it is pleasantly astringent, with flavors of tart cherry and blackberry."
A fresh nose with a whiff of briny apple sets up a palate of green pear and crushed stone. Lime and apple flavors are lasting and pure across the crisp finish.
"Aromas of red-skinned berry and graphite lift out of the glass. It's savory, doling out raspberry jam, clove and a touch of cinnamon alongside pliant tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
"This wine is juicy and crisp, with bright red-currant and cherry fruitiness. The fruit dominates, with plenty of acidity and a core of tannins to support it. It should be ready to drink from 2022."
"This blend was made to showcase grapes from a variety of ancient soils. The new vintage lacks the concentration of the 2014 but still expresses mild hints of rock, slate and shell under soft plum, cocoa and toasted grain flavors."
"Underbrush, game and black-plum aromas lead the way. On the earthy palate, close-grained tannins support prune, vanilla and tobacco. Drink through 2022."
"This is a testament to oak, having aged in 80% new French barrels for 15 months. Ripe and intense, it melds tart black olive and clove with plush rounded layers of caramel and coffee."
"Well structured due to firm tannins and acidity, this full-bodied wine is also a good value. It will pair well with the richest proteins and has lightly earthy and spicy aromas, vivid and taut flavors like fresh blackberries and a nicely gripping mouthfeel."
"As aromatic as expected of the variety, this has orange blossom, tangerine and orange pulp scents and flavors. With 21 g/L residual sugar, it's definitely off dry yet balanced with moderate acidity and low alcohol."
"Muted in leathery tobacco, this is a thick wine sticky in woody tannin and dusty stoniness. Decadent and concentrated, it offers layers and layers of blackberry and chocolate."
"Cabernet Franc edges out its companion Cabernet Sauvignon 54% to 46% in this light-bodied quietly ripe wine. Sage, cedar and fresh herb provide a vegetal underbelly that will appeal to fans of those flavors and style, with a juicy underbelly that's marked by a tartness of cranberry."
"Pert, sunny red cherry and strawberry on the nose turn to bolder shades of black cherry and berry on the palate. It's a ripe, concentrated Pinot Noir, with a slightly earthen, savory character and strident, slightly bitter tannins on the finish. Drink now through 2019."
"Aromas of dried black fruit, tobacco and carob lead the nose while the savory palate delivers prune, blackberry jam and a licorice accent. Velvety tannins provide polish. Drink through 2022."
"Offering a bit more concentration than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, this carries the winery's citrus-tinged acids, along with light raspberry and Bing cherry fruit. There's a hint that it's spent some time in new oak also. Aerate aggressively for optimum drinking."
"A light touch of cut grass leads to lemon rinds, citrus spray, Gala apples and a touch of guava on the nose of this widely available wine. It's clean and crisp on the palate, where stone fruit and apple flavors reign, set against a chalky texture."
"Made with 70% Corvina, 20% Rondinella and 10% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of red-skinned berry and dark spice. The soft, bright palate doles out red cherry and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Drink soon."
"Vibrant candied cherry, herb and baking spice aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors in this wine. The tannins bring a bit of grit to an otherwise enjoyable palate."
"Delicate aromas of apple skin, spring blossoms and lime zest carry the nose of this wine. The palate is a different beast all together, with far less fruitiness and far more mineralitytightly wound and chalky in texture. It's drinking well now, but would also be interesting to see it in a few years' time. Drink now2020."
"This full-bodied, rather blocky wine delivers generic tree fruit flavors of the sort often found in Chardonnay. Brief aging in once-used barrels has added a touch of vanilla and toasted hazelnut."
"Aromas of lime and dried mango are quiet on the nose. This Albario has the feel of pulpy citrus fruits, while a mix of briny tropical fruit flavors turns a bit green and peppery on the finish."
"Merlot makes up over two-thirds of this blend, with the balance in Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Baking spice, vanilla and plum aromas are at the fore. The tannins seem bunched up, however, and it lacks the generous fruit associated with the warm vintage."
"Blending four varietiesPinot Noir, Chardonnay, Gamay and Aligotthis wine shows both rich fruitiness and a crisp texture. Citrus and apple dominate this tangy wine that finishes with attractive acidity."
"This wine's aromas lack clarity, with wood spice and butterscotch notes at the fore. The palate is full of lip-smacking, medium-bodied dark fruit flavors. Baking spice and coffee notes linger on the finish."
"Light strawberry aromas meet with pink lemon and tangerine rinds on the simple nose of this bottling. The palate shows pleasant touches of strawberry and lemon as well as a touch of peat and pine smoke, but is missing some acidic boost."
"This basic, medium-bodied wine has straightforward plum and berry aromas. Its cherry, currant and mild chocolate flavors hum along, with little to no change on the finish. This may be simple, but it works."
"Peach, mango and crushed-stone aromas lead to a cidery, streamlined palate. Salty stone-fruit flavors lead in this barrel-aged Tempranillo Blanco, a fairly rare wine even for Rioja. On the finish, this is plump but lacking in structure. Drink now."
"Savory earthy accents complement ripe melon flavors and a generous texture in this pale-colored, medium-bodied wine. It has good heft on the palate, and is rich enough to keep the flavors lingering."
"This has delicate aromas of baking spice and red-skinned berry. Mirroring the nose, the no-frills, enjoyable palate offers red plum, vanilla and a hint of white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020."
"This coppery gold-hued wine is soft, round and dry and suggests early oxidation. Its simple tree fruit flavors bear a touch of lemon and honeycomb, though the finish is completely dry."
"Subdued aromas suggest prune, vanilla and baking spice while the ripe, straightforward palate presents fleshy black plum, toast and a hint of pipe tobacco. Smooth tannins lend easygoing support."
"Subdued aromas suggest Spanish broom and chamomile flower. Reflecting the nose, the lean, linear palate is also restrained, offering citrus, lemon zest and a hint of beeswax."
"Aromas of tilled soil and black plum lead into the straightforward palate along with prune, bitter almond and a note of baking spice. Round tannins offer support. Drink through 2019."
"There is some good concentration in this ripe, structured wine. With its core of tannins and its surrounding red-berry and cherry fruit, it is rich and needs a little more time. Drink from late 2018."
"This wine seems anxious, with an unfocused, nervous energy. Acidity, berry flavors, chalk and other mineral elements collide rather than combine. It may or may not improve with more bottle age. Two bottles were tasted, with comparable results."
"This is a voluptuously lush white wine awash in pineapple, honeyed pear, vanilla and toasty oak. Moderate acidity supports its rich ripe fruit-forward nature."
Earthier notes on first whiff dissipate with aeration to expose prettier aromas of strawberry and peach. The palate of this Pinot Noir ros is distinctly citrusy with unexpected hints of vanilla and cream. Drink now.
"Jammy berry aromas are more gritty than smooth. This feels chunky and on the heavy side, with power but little finesse. Extracted blackberry and cassis flavors finish with overt oak, related chocolate notes and rough tannins."
"A nose of grapefruit and lemon with a hint of thyme sets the stage for flavors of lemon-lime, pineapple, vanilla and white flowers. This wine is bright from first sip until lingering citrus finish."
"From Heart of the Hill Vineyard on Red Mountain, this leads with vanilla, clove and baking spice aromas and follows with tart, tangy fruit and barrel flavors. Cranberry notes linger on the finish, along with interesting acidity."
"This wine all comes from Oasis Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. Its red fruit, baking spice and medicine cabinet aromas are a bit difficult to tease out. The flavors, meanwhile, are at once lightly styled and jammy, finishing short with cranberry notes."
"Floral yet flat aromas are leafy and a touch green on the nose. This 100% Sumoll ros feels peachy and simple, with stone-fruit and berry flavors. Mild raspberry notes lend a red-fruit character to a wide but shapeless finish."
"There's a touch of fizz to the glass in this twist-top bottling, which shows light peach, yellow melon, sliced apple and orange-cake aromas. The flavors are subtle but the texture is decent with acidity and grip, allowing ripe pear and a touch of lime bitterness to arise slowly."
"The nose on this bottling is quite shy at first, and then slowly arise aromas of citrus pith, sliced Gravenstein apple and a mushroomy, woody component. The palate's citrus rinds, pomelo pith and hints of tangerine are presented on a well-wound frame."
"This Malbec-led blend has black fruit aromas with hints of Band-Aid and licorice root. It's chewy and dense but also a bit flat. Its plum and berry flavors are moderately oaky, showing rubbery tannins and an herbal aftertaste on the finish."
"From an up-and-coming vineyard, this exudes light green herb, macerated cherry, violet, citrus and barrel spice aromas. On the palate, full, slightly green dark fruit flavors are backed by tart acidity. The tannins are a touch dry, but there's promise here."
"A rich, fruity wine, this is rounded and ripe with white fruits. It shows a crisp edge and a touch of spice from oak aging. It will develop quickly to give an attractive wine from late 2018."
"Sourced from Art Den Hoed and Gunkel vineyards, this wine has high-toned red apple and barrel spice aromas and ripe, sweet red raspberry flavors. It's interesting, albeit cloying."
"Aromas of orange and vanilla turn more burnt and smoky as this Pinot Noir-Parellada brut ros opens up. The highly foamy mouthfeel carries rustic, spicy citrus flavors."
"This wine's aromas are a bit disjointed, its rose petal and spice notes seeming dried out. The palate is quite sweet, without the acidity to back it up."
"Mild white-fruit aromas carry the nose of this Biodynamic Sauvignon Blanc. Angular, tangy flavors of gooseberry and green plum carry the flavors and finish crisp and clean."
"Mellow aromas of pear, rainy sidewalk and nectarine show on the nose of this bottling. There is bountiful acidity on the sip, with cut grass and apple skin flavors."
"Aromas of orchard fruit and white flower lift out of the glass while the tangy palate offers citrus, yellow apple, saline and a hint of bitter almond. It's racy, with vibrant acidity."
"This opens with delicate aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit. It's easygoing, offering black cherry, red plum and vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2020."
"Fresh black cherry and plum are ripe and forward in this easy drinking Pinot Noir. It's a soft, sunny wine, with delicate acidity and plush tannins but refreshingly fruity. Drink now."
Earthy mineral notes are brightened by whiffs of white blossom and grapefruit in this subtly sweet Gewrztraminer. Soft acidity and feather-light texture add to its delicate feel. Drink now through 2019.
"Opening aromas suggest black-skinned berry and cooking spice. The firm palate shows ripe black cherry, nutmeg and cocoa alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2020."
"This opens with aromas of red plum, cooking spice and a hint of nutmeg. The no-frills palate shows black currant, clove and a black pepper note alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon."
"This excellent vineyard designate usually shows better, but here, the awkward, chalky acids overtake the cherry fruit. It may need more time in bottle, or may simply have required a different approach to acid adjustment during the winemaking process."
"Aromas of toast, tobacco and a hint of black-skinned berry meld together on this wine. The dense, robust palate delivers prune, vanilla and star anise alongside smooth tannins. Drink soon."
"Troon makes a pair of Vermentinos; this is the one with the red label. It's a spicy, peppery white with a funky kick to the finish. A mix of cucumber, lime and apple fruit, it carries a rather surprising leathery scent and flavor. Some tasters will consider that a plus."
"This unusual blend of Nebbiolo and Malbec feels compact but hard. Its reedy, stalky berry aromas are fiery, earthy and herbal. On the palate, spicy, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with peppery, minty notes."
"Two bottles of this wine were tasted, with vast differences. The first was dominated by a leathery, tack room aroma, which carried into the palate and obliterated the fruit. Some tasters attribute this to terroir, but it's in fact a flaw. The second bottle was much improved, showing black cherry fruit and proportionate tannins. The score is for that bottle, but beware the possibility of extreme variation."
"This wine's cherry-like fruit is plenty ripe, and the acidity has fresh-squeezed orange juice appeal. The only off note is a hint of plastic on the nose that carries into the palate."
"Out of the gate, this wine's oak is far out front, with vanilla and baking spice notes that obscure the fruit. The palate shows more of the same, though it settles down a bit with significant time open. It's a style, albeit over the top."
"Like many austere, power-packed 2014 Malbecs, this offers an intense attack. Its cool cola and blackberry aromas include a note of fennel. And its berry flavors are fiery and aggressive, with a long, drying, tannic finish."
"Hugely oaky, this wine also features a dustiness on the nose and palate, alongside woody tannin. Black olive and dried herb give it an herbaceous quality that belies its full-bodied richness and ripe core."
"This wine is full bodied, very ripe tasting and has a soft expansive mouthfeel. Touches of earth and barnyard join stewed plum flavors for a rustic but enjoyable taste profile."
"Light although sweet red-cherry-syrup aromas meet with iron and crushed sage on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The sip is simple yet tangy with tart red fruit, proving very easy to enjoy."
"This structured wine has a dense texture as well as red-cherry fruits. It is crisp, still young, with spice as well as some firm tannins. With this bright, fruity and young character, it will take some aging. Drink from late 2018."
"Denis Dutron has made a wine that is bright with acidity as well as warmer tropical-fruit flavors. Soft, easy and fruity, this delicious, crisp wine is ready to drink."
"Brooding aromas of dark plum, vanilla and spice lead to easy-drinking blue and black fruit flavors in this blend of 63% Syrah, 33% Merlot and 4% Viognier. It's a bit generic but delivers enjoyment all the same."
"Aromas of black-skinned berry and cake spice float out of the glass. The straightforward, medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, white pepper and hint of cinnamon, with firm tannins. Drink though 2019."
"This unoaked version of the variety, released quite young, is tightly wound and unyielding. Its jicama, apple and green melon fruit flavors are concentrated, belying the listed alcohol, which is evidenced only by some heat on the finish. Give it ample aeration or decanting."
"Basic wood smoke, plum and berry aromas are solid enough to mask some of this Cabernet's greener components. Its dense palate is pillowy, tasting of herbal blackberry and spice cake. Leafy berry notes and a touch of chocolate mark the finish."
"Aromas of orange peel and tarragon are spunky and a little green on the nose. This fresh, lean Garnacha Blanca shows moderate acidity and short flavors of green melon and almond skins. A bit of saltiness is present on a dry finish."
"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah offers earth, leather, latex and berry fruit aromas that are mildly aggressive. In the mouth, generic berry flavors come with a hint of herbal green on the finish."
"This wine's extremely tart berry fruit seems barely ripe, hinting at wild raspberries. It's a high-acid, stiff and herbal style, which seems to be intentional, as it was made with 50% whole clusters."
"From vines a quarter century old, this distinctive offering features fresh Mediterranean herb, apple and pear skin notes and a core of white peach, apple and jicama. Don't look for ripe fruit; the style here emphasizes subtle texture and herbal characteristics."
"You may find tasters divided on this wine; for some it will be delicious, for others overripe and alcoholic. It's definitely big in style, with quite ripe, almost raisiny fruit flavors, a hint of plastic on the nose and astringent tannins."
"Heavy oak and related char, chocolate and mocha aromas make up the nose of this dark, grippy Cabernet Sauvignon. There's plenty of oak flavor, along with herbal berry notes, but it finishes raw, tannic and scratchy, with a hard texture."
"Rich blackberry and candied black-cherry aromas meet with strong cedar, roast beef, smoke, olive, soy and a tarry quality on the nose of this bottling. It's very dry and sticky with tannins on the sip, which relegate the flavors of red cherry and roasting herbs to the background. The 100% American oak treatment remains prominent, so this may evolve more favorably with time."
"The aromas in this wine aren't entirely harmonious, with high-toned herb, spice and mineral notes. The palate, however, brings plenty of intrigue, with velvety-soft, mouth-coating red fruit flavors and savory herbal hints that linger on the finish. Unfortunately, the two don't sync up."
"The Smillon really takes the fore in this SBS blend. Wet wool, bruised citrus fruit and white pepper lead into a restrained, almost austere palate. The acidity is in check but the fruit is lacking. It all ends with an intriguing salty, copper-penny finish."
"This floral, aromatic wine is light, bright and enticingly fruity. Its light acidity and crisp, brisk texture are all attractive parts of a wine that is already very drinkable."
"Florally perfumed in orange blossom, this plush, medium-bodied white is awash in pineapple and a strong taste of cinnamon stick, its oak pronounced and supportive."
"Varietally familiar aromas of snappy citrus fruits are feline in nature. This is light in body, refreshing and citric. Flavors of lime and tangerine are stony and show a hint of green herbs, while this is lasting on a fresh finish."
"Black cherry, tobacco and baking-spice aromas lead the nose while the soft, ripe palate shows prune and white-pepper accents. Pliant tannins give it an easygoing nature. Drink soon."
"This clean and simple wine is a textbook example of Oregon Pinot Gris. Its lightly spiced pear and apple fruit is fresh and varietally correct, making for a pleasant sipper."
"This is a wide open, fruity wine, with upfront berry and citrus notes backed by chalky acids. It's a good, quaffable red but lacks the complex meat and compost notes often found in Northwest Syrahs."
"This long-established negociant house, based in Santenay, has made a generous, ripe white Burgundy. It is soft and smooth, with ripe red apple and quince fruit. Drink the wine now."
"This was harvested at low brix and fermented principally in French oak. It's a soft, floral take on Viognier, with scents and flavors that suggest baby powder. Because of its Meyer lemon and other candied citrus notes, odds are either a small amount of Gewrztraminer was blended in or some residual sugar remains, though neither is indicated. Drink now and over the next two to three years."
"This leads with flat, earthy raisin and prune aromas. The palate is bulky, thick and syrupy, with stewy cassis and berry flavors laced with coconutty oak. It's dense and slightly overdone on the finish."
"This is stiffly tannic, with red plum and spicy cherry fruit. It's a hard, chewy wine that could use some time to soften, but its rusticity is undeniably flavorful. Pair it with hearty winter stews or coq au vin."
"This new entry in the budget Pinot Noir market is perfectly fine, if ordinary. It offers tart berry, pomegranate and light herbal highlights. The tannins are proportionate, and everything is in balance. A fair wine at a fair price."
"This wine comes from just outside Meursault, giving both richness and juicy fruitiness. Apricots and ripe melon add to tastes of citrus and crisp apple to offer a wine that is fruity, soft, lightly buttery and ready to drink."
"Largely tannic and generous in oak, this is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Plum, currant, bread dough and leather are among the more powerful components, with a rich rounded mouthfeel providing approachability."
"This wine's plum and currant aromas are raw and wild, with a hint of animal and not a lot of overt ripeness. It's medium bodied and rubbery in mouthfeel, with a mix of salty and woody flavors and moderately ripe plum notes. On the finish, it tastes mostly of spicy oak and mint."
"Girardin, based in Meursault, has made a ripe, fruity red Burgundy that reflects the generous red fruits of the vintage. It is juicy, soft and rounded, with attractive acidity and light tannins. Drink now."
"This lightly vanilla- and spice-flavored wine is deliciously creamy. Flavors of apples and citrus burst out of the glass ripe, full and ready to drink."
"Consider 2015 an off year for this estate wine. Its thin red berry fruit comes with citrus flavors, high acidity and dry, astringent tannins. Some appealing cherry candy flavors emerge as the wine breathes, but it doesn't seem to have the depth to age. Drink now and over the next two to three years."
"The immediate and lasting impression is that this is a mighty peppery wine. Tart pomegranate fruit eventually kicks in, until it thins out into an astringent, and yes, peppery finish. It was aged in 35% new oak for 13 months."
"This blend of 50% Syrah, 30% Petite Sirah and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon offers a very rich nose of licorice, black currant leather, tobacco and potpourri. The palate is a tad sour and dried out, with black plum skins, purple flowers and peppery spice."
"This wine is spicy and earthy, with brawny, rustic and ripe waves of cherry and vanilla at its core. Simple in structure it's robust in tannin and oak, aspects that persist on the finish."
"Yeasty white-fruit aromas carry the nose. In the mouth, this basic Godello is fleshy and pulpy. A mix of citrus and nectarine flavors holds steady on a fresh but simple finish."
"This offers aromas of black plum and cooking spice while the firm palate shows blackberry jam, tobacco and black pepper. Closed-grained tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020."
"Subtle apple, lime and a sulphuric vegetal note combine in a refreshing wine that is restrained in nature. A slippery texture carries along these quiet notes to a stone-fruit and apple finish. Needs time to emerge from its shell. Drink 20192022."
"Aromas of creamy oak and corn stalk are oily, rich on the nose. In the mouth, this Chardonnay from Navarra is broad but with ample acidity. Woody, creamy pineapple and orange flavors finish steady and oaky."
"From an up-and-coming part of the Walla Walla Valley, this has barrel spice, raspberry and dried cherry aromas followed by somewhat elegant red fruit flavors that taper toward the finish. It doesn't all quite come together."
"Aromas of lemon rind, pineapple and cantaloupe pave the way for flavors of white flowers and melon. This finish is pleasant but overall a bit too perfumed."
"This wine is a blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 17% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot. The aromas are fruit-forward, with blackberry jam and other black fruit notes. The palate is more reserved than the aromas suggest, with drying tannins. It has a bit of a hole in the middle, but there's still enjoyment to be had."
This leads with maple and burnt oak aromas and follows with crushed fruit scents that turn earthy and herbal with air. It's a big but plodding Cabernet with spicy baked blackberry flavors that end with power and rough tannins.
"Ripe raspberry and black-pepper aromas take center stage here. This wine is straightforward, offering black-cherry jam, licorice and a note of white pepper alongside smooth tannins."
"Young and still showing a yeasty aroma, this crisp white wine mixes green apple and green melon flavors with a touch of jicama. It's ready to go and should be consumed over the next year. There's a light hint of cracker on the finish."
"This wine's saucy wild berry aromas are accompanied by herb, spice and meat notes. Its choppy, tannic palate is grippy to the extreme, tasting of herbal berry fruits, savory spice and peppercorn. On the finish, a dark foresty note enters the picture."
"This blend of Mourvdre, Grenache and Malbec is dark and slightly minty, with sweet cherry fruit at the core. The acidity is moderate but firm enough to keep it upright, and a light touch of leather runs throughout."
"This opens with aromas of red plum, underbrush and cooking spice. The medium-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, star anise and a touch of licorice alongside smooth tannins. Drink soon."
"This crisp wine has a creamy background, making for a ripe, fruity wine with tangy orange and lemon flavors along with touches of vanilla. It is still young and could do with a few more months, so wait until mid 2018."
"Sour grapefruit pith, wet clay, cut grass and a hint of white flowers show on the slightly reductive nose of this bottling, which opens up with a bit of patience. The acidity gives zip to the sip, where wet concrete and lime skin flavors shine."
"Tannic and rustic, this is a straightforward presentation of ripe rich plum and oak, along with sizable seasonings of pepper and leather."
"This unusual blend is two thirds Pinot Noir, the rest split between Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc. The white varieties seem to dilute the red, without contributing much else, leaving heavy tannins intact. Along with black fruit, there are thick, chewy tannins."
"This crisp, fruity wine is lively, with considerable acidity as well as red berry fruits. The tannins are still young, forming a solid core that will soften. Drink from 2021."
"The 2016 is a crisp vintage in Chablis and this bright, tangy wine reflects it. It has plenty of lemon acidity, orange zest and liveliness that has been partially smoothed out by some wood aging. Drink this wine from late 2018."
"This wine's grapey berry aromas are clean but basic. It has a focused, sinewy mouthfeel and lightly salty plum and berry flavors. Touches of herbs, spice and salt are present on the finish."
Spicy mint and tobacco leaf linger around a lightly structured wall of tart earth and cola in this site-designate wine.
"Yeasty aromas of Animal Cracker cookies and vanilla mask fruit tones on the nose. This vineyard-designated Albario shows flavors of briny apple and stone fruits, with a slightly bitter, monotone finish."
"Dry, earthy aromas suggest brick dust, red fruit, cardamom and cinnamon in this Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend. It's raw and wide, with edgy tannins, exotic spice, berry and minty oak flavors, and a scratchy finish."
"Tart, tight and unyielding, this wine's apple flavors aren't exactly thin, but they seem charmless. Acidity lends a lemon juice flavor, and time in 50% new oak has had little impact."
"This wine was aged in half French and half American oak, 60% new. Wood spice, vanilla, plum and herb aromas lead to a broad palate that mixes fruit and barrel in equal parts, the two persisting on the finish."
"Pops of sweet, juicy yellow cherry, honey and caramel burst on the nose and palate of this robust off-dry Gewrztraminer. It's ripe and clingy on the palate but balanced by sunny tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2019."
"Cocoa, woodspice, licorice and cherry aromas are out in front in this wine, accenting light-bodied dark fruit flavors. The tannins seem a bit gritty, but it otherwise provides appeal."
"Deep gold in color, this opens with aromas of beeswax, chamomile, acacia and mature yellow stone fruit. The lean palate offers dried yellow apple, lemon and saline alongside bright acidity."
"Shy at first, several swirls in the glass reveal notes of sour cherry, florals, cocoa nibs and some oak spice. The palate follows with more ripe, tangy fruit and florals. It's medium bodied with balanced acidity. Drink now."
"This is a 100% varietal wine, aged for 20 months in French and Hungarian oak. Tart and plushy, it has a level of rusticity that serves it well. Thick tannins meet a smoky oaky core of wood and dried herb."
"With a buttered-toast aroma, this rich wine is spicy, creamy and ripe. It is buttery, smooth and generously textured. It comes from the son of a Chablis producer who has set up his own negociant business. Drink this superripe wine now."
"Light black cherry aromas meet with a bit of rose petal, vanilla and pie crust on the rustic nose of this bottling. It's easy sipping on the palate, where roasted red berries meet with hot earth and a touch of charred beef."
"This leads with minty herbal aromas like juniper and eucalyptus. Upon airing, dark fruit notes emerge, along with some oak. On the palate, it's more rough than smooth, holding herbal black currant and chocolate flavors. By the time it finishes, its berry flavors are on par with its strong herbal notes."
"Aromas suggesting black-skinned berry and almond unfold in the glass. The dense palate shows fleshy black cherry, baked plum and a hint of cinnamon alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020."
"Delicate aromas of apple, nut and a whiff of acacia mingle together while the rather subdued, light-bodied palate shows suggestions of pear and citrus. An almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter close."
"This opens with aromas suggesting prune and underbrush while the straightforward palate evokes blackberry jam, raisin and a hint of chocolate. It's already accessible, with supple tannins."
A dash of Carignane contributes to the whole of this easygoing likable wine. Softly layered baked plum and prune flavors are given additional heft and roundness from a richer undertone of caramel and brown sugar.
"This has generic berry aromas, with a strawberry candy note. Its saturated palate hits with drying tannins, while clove and bitter chocolate flavors accent stewed berry notes. Oak and toast dominate the finish."
This is the first vintage of this estate-grown Tempranilloa rare grape in the Willamette Valley. It's a bit high-toned and right on the edge of vinegary. Roasted flavors of charred red fruit and a hint of smoke come through on the finish. This is a love-it-or-leave-it wine with no middle ground.
"This opens with aromas of oak, blackberry and baking spice. The dense, taut palate shows black currant, toast and vanilla alongside tightly wound tannins. Drink through 2020."
"Vincent's Pinot Noirs are fermented with native yeasts in a mix of once-used and older barrels. This bottling opens with fresh strawberry and raspberry flavors, lemony acids, and an underpinning of wet stone. It's on the lighter side and was made (and priced) for everyday enjoyment."
"This reserve-level Pinot Noir spent 17 months in neutral oak yet carries strong scents and flavors of vanilla and toast. Those elements accent a core of preserved strawberry fruit. If that hits the mark for your palate, you'll want to drink this while it's young and fresh."
"Delicate aromas of black-skinned berry and baking spice introduce this easygoing red. The straightforward palate offers red cherry, cinnamon and a hint of white pepper alongside round tannins. Drink soon."
"White blossoms, yeast, apple, and peach and something a little sweaty proceed towards a palate that is almost gritty in texture, with more floral and apple notes and the region's characteristic searing acidity."
"Relatively elegant aromas of black currant, blueberry, loam, oregano and thyme show on the nose of this widely available bottling. The palate is simpler, with cocoa dust, black cherry, pepper and tannins that tighten into the finish."
"This soft and creamy wine has a gentle mousse and ripe white-fruit flavors. Its open, rounded character and warm aftertaste make it ideal as an apritif."
"This opens with aromas of underbrush and black-skinned berry while the straightforward palate offers vanilla, black cherry and a touch of almond. It's easygoing, with round tannins. Drink through 2020."
"Plummy flavors and a broad, soft texture make this wine taste ripe and plush. It blends lightly smoky and oaky nuances with butter and jam that accentuate an almost sweet character."
"Aromas of white-fruit and yeast is mild on the nose. On the palate, this brut nature is lean and acidic, with a mouthfeel defined by lime juice and wet stone. Green-fruit flavors are slightly oxidized on a quick-fading finish with green-herb notes."
"Half Barbera, half four other red grapes, this features a handsome black dog on the label. It's blood-black in the glass also, with plum, chocolate and leather flavors in equal proportion. Depending upon your tolerance for leathery reds, it may surprise or disappoint."
"Pleasant fig and pear flavors fill out this medium-bodied and rather subtly flavored wine. It tastes ripe enough, but not overly rich, has good concentration and an earthy component"
"Aromas of cedar, black-skinned berry and a whiff of tobacco lead the way. The firm palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and a hint of star anise alongside mellow tannins. Drink soon."
"Soft and accessible, this opens with aromas of vanilla, mature blackberry and exotic spice. The mellow palate delivers ripe black plum, cinnamon and white pepper alongside lithe tannins."
"This wine pulls from across the wider appellation to combine cool-climate grapes with warmer regions. Round and easygoing, it offers fleshy fine flavors of pineapple and peach, its oak integrated and unobtrusive."
"Extreme lawn clipping and green bell pepper aromas show on the nose of this bottling, with slightly rounder hints of guava, passion fruit and struck flint also arising. It's a bit riper on the sip, with yellow pear, Key lime, rainy cement and wet hay flavors."
"Light and fruity, this gently creamy wine is cut with tangy acidity. This balance gives the wine a delicious, crisp present and the possibility of a few more years aging. It is all fruit, with no sign of wood, and will be ready from mid 2018."
"Crisp and simple, this is a bright, citrus-flavored wine. Acidity and a clean, clear character give it liveliness. The wine is all fruit with no sign of wood, so drink early from summer 2018."
"A heavy coating of oak dominates over mild fruit tones on the nose. This old-vine Garnacha Blanca is textured, with briny white-fruit and resiny oak flavors."
"This spent 17 months in barrel, which has substantially softened the mouthfeel, with suggestions of early oxidation. Its lightly spicy apple pie flavors seem a bit faded, heading past their prime. Drink soon."
"An abundance of white flowers and sweet grassiness (along with some ripe pear) shows on the nose of this bottling from a newer property in Temecula. Apples and nectarine flavors reveal themselves at first on the sip, which then grows more sour with cut grass and apple rind elements."
"Very clean aromas of Pink Lady apple, ripe Asian pear, squeezed Meyer lemon and a touch of wet stone prove refreshing on the nose of this bottling. There's a hint of peach and Key lime pie ripeness to the sip, yet the wet cement minerality also shows through. It could use a touch more zippy acid."
"Peppery and herbal, this is a lightly spicy mix of rhubarb and strawberry fruit. It does not express the general ripeness and fruitiness of the vintage but will drink well over the next few years."
"This perfumed wine is ripe and packed with red fruits. Its soft texture, generous fruits and acidity are balanced to give a smooth, rich wine that will be ready to drink in 2018."
"Crisp and creamy, this wine is light, poised and ready to drink. It has a tangy edge with a steely core to balance the smooth fruit. Drink now."
"From southern Burgundy vineyards, this ripe and creamy wine is soft and packed with fruit. Its acidity and crisp texture contrast with the apple and pear flavors. This forward wine is ready to drink."
"Soft, creamy and full of ripe yellow fruits, this smooth, unctuous wine reflects the rich vintage. Its acidity fits well with this juicy fruitiness giving a balanced, easy wine that will be ready to drink from late 2018."
"The shy nose eventually reveals ripe black fruit and raisin aromas. Dense and robust, the palate shows blackberry jam, prune and white pepper alongside supple tannins. Drink soon."
"Briny, bready aromas suggest sourdough on the nose. In the mouth, this is solid but shows mild complexity. Orange and nectarine flavors include a spot of yeast, leading to a clean, dry finish."
"Ripe aromas of prune and blackberry come with a hint of green. A dense, tannic palate holds rich flavors of prune and plum. A toasty, oaky finish is spicy but short."
"This shows that classic aged Riesling petroleum character along with lemon-lime citrus. While the fruit is absent on the palate, texturally it's still lean and laser sharp, indicating it's still an infant. The low alcohol is a bonus too. Drink 20192027."
"This wine's cherry and blackberry aromas are basic. It's firm and tannic on the palate, with minimal depth. Dry, salty plum and berry flavors show a touch of oak. A blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Franc, it's rough on the finish."
"Cured meat and oak add richness to an otherwise light-bodied expression of the grape. Floral in apple blossom aromas, it follows through with additional flavors of Gravenstein apple, pear and a lemony hit of freshness on the finish."
"Sourced from an experimental block planted in 1978, this is a compact wine with clean apple fruit and toasted hazelnut scents. It's not yet showing all its complexity, so decant or tuck it away for a couple more years."
"Six barrelsone each from six vineyardscomprise this cuve. This vintage is on the earthy side, with soil, skin and bark flavors alongside light plum and berry fruit. The acids, as in most of the winery's Pinots, leave a chalky aftertaste."
"Medium in body and high in acidity, this herbal wine shows a tartness of sour cherry and baked rhubarb flavor, held tight within a subtle casing of oak."
"The best of Vincent's vineyard designates, this shows riper fruit than the others, with red plum, cocoa and dried herb notes in the mix. An impression of Red Hots candy comes across on the nose and adds a hint of spice to the palate."
"Though 18 months in neutral oak is indicated in this wine's technical notes, it has an arrestingly toasty scent and flavor, which may indicate some other form of oak addition. It shows pretty, though simple, red fruit and is pleasantly appealing. Drink over the next year or two."
"Toasty and tart, this is a straightforward Chardonnay with clean varietal character. There's nothing to distinguish it, but for the price it offers fair value and decent flavor."
"Pungent lemony notes are followed by vanilla, butter and some vegetal character in the background. The buttery texture on the palate is classic oak-aged Chardonnay, with fleeting fruit flavors that race along the mouth-puckering acidity. Try this again in a few years' time when the acidity will hopefully have calmed down."
"This wine's cantaloupe, apple, grapenut and pear aromas pop. The palate is upfront, dropping off considerably on the back end. Yet, it still provides enjoyment."
"Alta Alella's entry into the natural wine world comes via this Mataro (Mourvdre) from Catalonia. Reduced, raisiny aromas push the nose to the outer limits of acceptable ripeness, while this feels saturated. Prune and grapy fruit flavors simmer on the finish."
"A peach aroma mixes with notes of lees and crushed stone on the nose. The palate is citric and streamlined, with lean tangerine flavors that turn a touch oily and fleshy on the midpalate, but ultimately racy on the finish."
"This blend of Malbec and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc has generic ripe berry and cassis aromas. On the palate, it's medium bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Its herbal berry fruit and oak flavors persist on a steady finish."
"This wine's birthday cake, baking spice, herb and licorice aromas lead to plentiful dark fruit flavors backed by slightly green tannins. It doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened."
"Apple and citrus aromas are starting to show some age-based corn and wheat notes on the nose. A solid palate is compact and narrow, while apple and stone-fruit flavors exhibit mild bitterness. The finish is tangy, with a modest burn. Drink now."
"This opens with aromas of carob and spirit-soaked cherry. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black cherry, nutmeg and a touch of fig alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020."
"Aromas of yellow apple, wet stone and baked bread lead the nose and carry over to the bright, light-bodied palate along with hints of dried herb and lemon drop. A saline note fills in the finish."
"This comes from a vineyard 1,400-feet elevation, and it is blended with 14% Petite Sirah. Thick tannins surround a core of extracted red cherry and blueberry fruit; the texture is mild and fleshy."
"This is a ripe wine, fruity with blackberries and black plums. Juicy acidity and tannins work just right as a core of structure. Belonging to the same family for six generations, the estate is in the Entre-deux-Mers region. Drink from late 2018."
"Charred oak and slightly overripe aromas make for a bullish nose. On the palate, this delivers a jolt of acidity along with oversize tannins, while ripe plum and cassis flavors."
"Fresh lemon and lime zest aromas are sharp in the nose of this bottling, cutting into the oak smoke character. The mouthfeel is round and creamy, with more oak as well as melted butter, apple and lemon flavors. It is a solid midweek Chard."
"Soft and fruity, this attractive wine reflects the generous 2015 vintage in red wines. It is full of red-cherry and red-currant fruit, cut with just the right acidity and ready to drink from mid 2018."
"This is a smooth, ready-to-drink wine with attractive acidity and crisp pear and quince flavors. With bright, orange zest accents and mineral texture, the wine is totally refreshing."
This single-vineyard wine is already mature with juicy red fruits now evolving into secondary flavors. An earthy character gives the wine density and weight. The aftertaste has acidity and softness. Drink now.
"This wine, which includes a small amount of Gewrztraminer, is off dry, with powdered sugar, lime, Meyer lemon and orange creamsickle flavors."
"This wine is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon (70%), with equal parts Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot. Despite the even growing season, it doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with jalapeo pepper, baking spice and plum aromas. The flavors are light to medium bodied and drop off on the finish."
"Lots of whole bunch stalkiness happening here, showing notes of Big Red gum blended with cherry cola. The intense cinnamon and red fruit characters continue on the palate where there's a tannic grip and good amount of acidity. While winemaking technique overpowers terroir here, this is nevertheless a fashionable style plenty of people will enjoy."
"Minty wintergreen scents lead the nose of this wine and carry into the flavors. Other fresh herbal notes are also in play, with a tight core of crisp apple flesh and skin. It's a rather austere style that might pair well with shellfish."
"Fresh Key lime aromas meet with touches of guava, plumeria and lemongrass on the steely nose of this bottling. There's a great sizzle of acidity to the sip, leaning a bit more toward Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay, with flavors of guava gum, green papaya, lime and grass."
"This is a promising wine for SoCal Chardonnay, starting with aromas of lemon peels, sea salt, cream and honeysuckle. The palate is a tad sweet, with apple syrup and candied lemon flavors, but the mouthfeel is creamy and the acidity is good."
"A bit disappointing, this tannic wine spent 17 months in half new oak. Its light rhubarb and berry flavors are overtaken by astringent tannins that leave a bitter aftertaste. More bottle age may help smooth them out."
"This wine's aromas aren't entirely settled, with dried cherry, spice, herb and game notes. Its cherry flavors are ripe, full and dry but dip in the middle. It has pleasing components, but they don't all come together."
"This wine's melon and stone fruit aromas are a touch briny. It's linear on the palate, lacking depth and volume. With salty, oaky apple flavors, it leaves a lasting briny impression on a finish led by oak."
"This soft and fruity wine brings out all the succulent red-fruit flavors of the vintage. Light on tannins, rich in juiciness, it is ready to drink."
"With fruit from Les Collines, McKinley Springs and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this offers coconut, vanilla and baking spice aromas and full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The oak influence is pretty intense."
"This opens with aromas of black cherry, bitter almond and graphite. On the palate, blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon accompany chewy tannins. Drink through 2020."
"This wine's cool, earthy aromas are low on fruit and heavy on oak, recalling resin and maple. The palate is laden with blocky tannins, showing spiced plum, mincemeat pie and dry oak flavors that lead into a raw finish."
"This is a fruit bomb of a ros, packed with rhubarb, strawberry and cherry flavors. Though made in stainless steel tanks, it has a whiff of white chocolate also. It finishes dry, though rounded off with enough sweetness to smooth out the acids."
"Reflecting a hot and dry vintage, this blend smells a bit raisiny and overripe. In the mouth, hard tannins make for a rough and rugged palate, while flavors of tomato, green herbs, prune and spice finish similarly baked, herbal and tomatoey. This is a blend of 55% Tempranillo, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot."
"This barrel-fermented Navarran Chardonnay is gold in color, with a matte finish and a resiny mouthfeel. Woody, spicy flavors gleaned from copious oak dominate a flavor profile of creamy melon notes. Lasting oak carries the finish."
"This wine offers plenty of funk notes: raw meat and barnyard with cherry notes far in the background. The palate, however, is another beast all together in its red fruit and searing acidity."
"Freshness is the story in this lightly herbal Malbec-Bonarda blend. In the mouth, it's snappy and tight, with generic but racy berry flavors that stay juicy through the finish. Consider chilling this prior to pouring."
"This opens with aromas of tilled earth, ripe black-skinned fruit and underbrush. The straightforward palate delivers mature black plum, vanilla and nutmeg framed in polished tannins."
"This wine is principally Merlot and Syrah, along with a dash of Cinsault. The aromas are high toned out of the gate, with red fruit, vanilla, plum and spice notes. The palate is soft and elegant in style, with a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward, easy drinker."
"Extremely vigorous bubbles want to explode with the slightest swirl of the glass on this bottling, which is pretty solid for the price. Aromas of candied strawberry, yeast and cherry Starburst candy show on the nose, while the palate carries flavors of stewed strawberry and a hint of yeast. It's slightly sweet but not overbearing and will please a diverse crowd."
"This is a pretty sunset rose color and offers gentle, somewhat muted flavors of rhubarb and bramble berry. Meyer lemon and orange peel highlights accent the midpalate, which opens up with a flash of cherry pie flavor."
"Rather reserved on the nose, this 50-50 blend of Syrah and Tempranillo shows light aromas of black cherry, vanilla, purple flowers and cola. The palate starts soft and mellow, with more cherry, vanilla and slight clove flavors that ride a steadily rising acidity, and finish on vanilla."
"This wine's berry and plum aromas are standard and don't offend in any way. It feels a bit lean yet is fresh and crisp. Its spicy plum and currant flavors are mildly reedy, while spice notes and dryness drive the finish."
"The label displays asterisks between G, S and M, perhaps because the blend also includes 13% Sangiovese. It hasn't yet come together, with various components sticking out. Baking spice, leather, blackberry, dust and vanilla notes are some of the puzzle pieces that don't find a seamless fit."
"This wine's dark, blood-like color and oaky, resiny aromas don't scream Pinot Noir. In the mouth, it's full but drying. Resiny oak flavors are more prominent than fruit, and a final note of raisin marks the heavy finish."
"Saint-Bris is the only appellation in Burgundy where Sauvignon Blanc is grown. The style, as in this wine, hints at herbal while going more for riper fruits. Tangy acidity and attractive rich fruits come together in a crisp wine that is ready to drink now."
"This opens with aromas of prune, tobacco and toast. The simple palate offers blackberry jam, vanilla and star anise alongside round tannins. Drink soon."
"Aromas suggest black-skinned berry and clove. The simple palate offers wild cherry and a white-pepper note, with easygoing tannins. Drink soon."
"This wine's roasted aromas are more rooty and reedy than ripe, with a leathery note. Its firm palate contains stalky berry flavors that hint at smoked meat and herbs, especially on the finish."
"This has plenty of ripe, tart raspberry fruit, accented with pretty spice. A strong leathery scent and flavor mutes it somewhat, and the tannins dry out the finish."
"This Malbec is wide and full, lacking in cut and structure. Its chunky plum and berry aromas are a bit spicy, and its plum and herbal berry flavors finish round, with spice notes and dry tannins."
"Oaky, charred notes cover most of the dull black fruit aromas in this Malbec-Syrah blend. The palate feels ripe in the middle but raw around the edges, with raisin, prune and baking spice flavors that seem heavy and stewed but not entirely lost to overripeness."
"Among a range of terroir-driven Burgundies from Florent Rouve are his Maons. This soft, simply fruity wine is ready to drink. With attractive acidity as well as crisp apple fruitiness, it is bright with citrus and zest at the end. Drink now."
"Earthy in rose petal and forest floor, this wine is medium bodied and somewhat tannic, with a finesse of raspberry and strawberry flavor. It shows well and is made in volumes that provide affordability and accessibility."
"This wine is an unusual blend of 30% Petit Verdot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Tempranillo, 17% Syrah and 12% Merlot. Aged in 50% new American oak for 40 months, it offers baking spice, garden herb and red cherry aromas, followed by a somewhat green and gritty palate. A tart, bitter note distracts on the finish."
"Jumpy aromas of blackberry Kool-Aid are common for a joven. In the mouth, this feels chunky and grabby, with punchy acidity. Salty berry and plum flavors come with abrasive tannins and an aftertaste of oak."
"Heavy bubbles and aromas of apple and pickle juice are intense. Round in mouthfeel, flavors of tart citrus are offset by mealy notes. This tastes mostly of briny, salty orange on the sizable finish."
"Vinified in stainless steel, this is a fresh-tasting though rather generic white wine. Its delicate flavors conjure up cucumber, gooseberry and white melon. It's a simple sipper that might best accompany a no-frills poultry dish."
"A simple but appealing Merlot. Ripe red and black fruit, chocolate and some herbal oak notes are followed by a plush, fruity palate. The alcohol is a little hot but this is nevertheless an easygoing weeknight red."
"Call this a confounding Cabernet Sauvignon, which is proving not to be Pulenta's best grape. It's tomatoey and earthy on the nose and heavy and cloying on the palate, tasting at once overripe and weedy. Compelling one moment and off putting the next, this is no easy wine to process."
"This wine reaches the extreme end of the buttery scale, showing toasty, oaky aromas, butter and vanilla flavors, a very creamy, rich texture and very full body. It has little overt fruit expression but plenty of complexity and savory character."
"Soft, delicate perlage and plush tropical fruit tones lend a sunny, easy feel to this sparkling blend. It's brut in style, with zesty acidity lending balance to more dulcet flavors of banana and apricot preserve. Drink now."
"Raisiny aromas are obvious but not over the top. This basic Toro is expansive but a touch heavy in fell. Raisin and black plum flavors are more baked than fresh, while this is compact on the finish."
"Cooked aromas of raisin and prune make this feel heavy and off balance. Its dark, minty raisin and prune flavors lack clarity and focus, even on the stewed finish."
"This offers aromas of green pepper, tobacco and black-skinned fruit. The palate is soft and ripe, with dried black cherry, prune and white-pepper accents. Drink soon."
"Subtle aromas of baking spice, mature black plum and vanilla slowly come together on this. It's quite simple, offering flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg, with round tannins."
"This simple wine shows strawberry cotton candy, candy corn, chocolate malt and herbal notes, all very light. Drink up."
Fresh aromas of green apple and melon meld with a note of yeast on the nose. A solid palate holds mild citrus and green-herb flavors that lead to the straightforward finish.
"Wood, sweet spice and plum aromas are out front in this wine. The palate is broad, with abundant plum flavors and astringent tannins. Baking spice notes linger on the finish. It's not obviously Merlot, but there's enjoyment to be had."
"The nose on this bottling is very showy with aromas of apple blossom, cut Anjou pear and guava. The palate skews tropical, with green papaya and underripe banana flavors, and a decently fresh acidity."
"Mealy berry aromas are stewy and topped with a heavy load of oak-based carob and cocoa. In the mouth, this Garnacha feels sticky and dense. Dried dark-fruit flavors finish woody and medicinal, with heat and excess weight."
"Made from an unusual white grape rarely seen in Oregon, this was partially fermented in new French oak. That's counterintuitive for such a generally crisp, high acid white wine with cucumber notes. More bottle age may smooth it out a bit."
"Light and fresh on the nose, this bottling has aromas of black olive, chile pepper, red cherry, cranberry and crushed pencils. The herbal character shows loudly on the palate, alongside cocoa, tart red cherry and cooked olives."
"Honey, lemon blossoms, orange oil and the slightest hint of petrol show on the nose of this dessert wine, which smells a bit syrupy. That viscosity is evident on the sip, which is extremely sweet and rich, though there is a background of lime zest and lemon-verbena-powered acid to give depth."
"This wine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. The barrel influence is way up front, recalling vanilla, wood spice, baking spice and green herbs. The palate comes off as quite woody as well, with blocky tannins and a vanilla-filled finish."
"Subdued aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit guide the nose while the dense palate offers clove, ripe black plum and vanilla. Round, closed-grained tannins provide the framework."
"This Bordeaux blend is from a notoriously wet and cold South Aussie vintage. The result is a vegetal wine, with notes of cooked green beans, charred meat, and dark raisiny fruit. While the nose appeals, the palate is on the oaky side, with angular, muscular tannins and a rather funky-filled finish."
"Roasted plum and berry fruit aromas along with a touch of oaky latex open this blend of Malbec and Syrah. The palate is fresh and choppy but also tannic. Plum, raspberry, rubber and salt flavors carry into the finish."
"Stiff, herbal and tannic, this wine seems reluctant to offer much fruit. What it has in abundance are stem and skin flavors, which may be intentional but offer little pleasure."
"Frankly herbal in flavor, this wine smells reduced at first, like garlic and onions, but mellows to celery, cucumber and lemon on the palate. It's medium to full in body, has a rich texture and lingering veggie finish."
White-fruit and citrus aromas are mild but clean on the nose. This has a light-bodied palate and tart flavors of orange and lime. A juicy finish hangs around for a few moments then dissipates.
"Mineral-driven on the nose, the palate of this Verdejo is citrusy in feel, with a grippy texture. Flavors of nectarine and peach are mild on a fresh finish."
"From a site high atop Glen Ellen's eastern edge, this estate-grown wine is brawny in leather, with a touch of sweetness to the oak. Robust wood flavor and tannin combine to emphasize the force and concentration of this wine, which has a puckering sensation of cedar and violet."
"Subtle dark-berry aromas meet with hearty spices, including pepper dust, cigar box and wood varnish. The oak is prominent throughout, with flavors of pine, bay leaf, eucalyptus oil and dried cherries on the sip."
"Very light in the glass, there is a subtle but growing tropicality on the nose of this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Grenache Blanc and 20% Viognier, with papaya, banana flower sap, candied honeysuckle and a bit of tuberose. The palate is clean with decent acidity, but those candied tropical flavors are overpowering, with mango, guava and banana syrup."
"This blended ros is comprised of 56% Pinot Gris, 25% Pinot Noir and 19% Grenache (from the Rogue Valley). Watermelon and tart strawberry fruit flavors combine, with a sour tang to the finish. Drink this chilled or try it in a sangria."
"This wine's odd name would seem to indicate there's Chardonnay in the blend, but in fact it's only Pinot Noir. Although technically a white, the color and flavor say ros. Light rhubarb and strawberry fruit comes forward, with a round, pleasant mouthfeel. Drink up."
"Soft red cherry and plum flavors are smooth in this ripe, fruity red. While a touch reedy and woody, it boasts pleasant licorice and spice notes, along with feather-light tannins. Drink now."
"This is a full-bodied white rich in buttery oak and baked apple, with a tang of lemon and a yeasty nose of baked biscuit."
"This wine's bright blueberry syrup, boysenberry and vanilla aromas lead to soft, plump, easy-drinking blue fruit flavors that persist on the finish."
"Fermented in stainless steel and barrel aged, this hearty wine is soft and simple with a juiciness of Kool-Aid-like flavors and dusty leather."
"Resiny oak is the dominant aroma on this barrel-fermented Godello. That heavy oak character carries straight to the palate, which tastes severely resiny. Oak and hidden white-fruit flavors are about all that's present on the finish."
"Generic berry and plum aromas come with notes of rubber and latex in this Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot blend. On the palate, it's blocky, with minty, spicy berry flavors and drying tannins."
"Sweet spice and raspberry flavors get this wine up and running, but the winery's propensity for leathery reds once again mutes the fruit. It finishes with a bitter and astringent aftertaste."
"Tight and crisp, this wine has red-currant fruits and plenty of acidity. It is crunchy, structured and very fresh. It will take time to soften and open up, so drink from 2021."
"This Cabernet's woody red fruit aromas lead to a soupy palate with tomato-like acidity. Tomato, herb and plum flavors carry into a steady but unexciting finish with residual oak."
"This wine is ripe with full-bodied tropical-fruit flavors that are cut with lime acidity. It is a warm, open wine from a rich vintage, full of fruit and without any wood aging. Drink now."
"This is a simple, fruity, quaffable wine with light baked apple and cinnamon flavors. It's balanced and soundly made, though insubstantial."
"Very light in the glass, this wine shows fresh honeydew aromas along with sweet peach, honeysuckle and slightly tart orange rinds. The easy simple flavors include peach and ripe apple."
"This smooth, ripe and creamy wine offers rich vanilla and apple flavors. It is open, full of fruit and with a tangy texture. The acidity is a good support for a generous wine that's ready to drink."
"This salmon-colored wine offers a bouquet of strawberry and white peach. Flavors of pomegranate, clementine, passion fruit and vanilla are set amid moderate tannins that afford rich mouthfeel before fading into a bright tangerine finish."
"Bob Pepi is listed as the winemaker for this tightly woven, understated effort, which shines in red and black currant as well as blackberry succulence. Smoky, it finishes in warmer richer tones of bacon and leather."
Sweet-seeming shadings of oak complement substantial fruit flavors like black cherry and blackberry in this fresh concentrated wine. It has good acidity and mild tannins for that welcome grip on the palate.
"Syrah comprises 55% of this blend, followed by 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, 6% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot. Smoky oak encases compressed, meaty blackberry and big notions of tannin and oak. The finish flirts with overripe heat."
"This is a rich, toasty wine showing notes of chocolate, blackberry, vanilla and pea shoots. The palate is a little hot and dense in dark berries, auspicious oak and a savory finish. Drink now with food until 2025."
"This wine's herbal berry and tomato aromas are as wild as the high desert it hails from. In the mouth, it's loud, with currant and plum flavors that finish with a note of fiery heat and residual acidity."
"Fresh pear and apple aromas are light, simple and clean. Like almost all Txakoli, this is acidic and highly citric in feel, with flavors of lemon and underripe pineapple."
"Gritty, with explosive power midpalate, this has a tartness of acidity that stands up to a softness of texture and tangy red fruit."
Very ripe fruit flavors and a sweet brown-sugar impression make this medium-bodied wine showy in the vein of a red blend. It feels rather soft on the palate and a hint of sweetness carries through on the finish.
"From a challenging vintage, this wine is quite light, with barely ripe strawberry fruit. It spent 18 months in French oak, and the barrel character dominates. It tastes mostly of mocha and caramel and should be consumed over the next year."
"This wine's scents and flavors suggest cracker and dried grain, while its tangy, herbal fruit suggests peashoot and grapefruit. It shows varietal character, but it's almost like drinking it through gauze; it's already fading."
"Bitter peach pit and burnt orange aromas open this tan-colored Cava. A soft, lightly citric mouthfeel could use more acid, while this tastes of grape skins and stale grapefruit. A short finish introduces green-herb notes."
"With bright red fruits and crisp acidity, this wine sums up the fruitiness of this vintage. A dry edge balances the red-currant fruit and acidity. Attractive now, it will be better from 2018."
"Briny, funky aromas of cured ham, stone fruits and salt water are unique for the area. This blend of Viura and Garnacha Blanca is linear and acidic, with lightly oxidized, barrel-driven flavors of boiled ham and dried apricot."
"This is a soft wine, smooth and creamy. The simple apricot and ripe pear flavors and easy style make it ready to drink. At the end, a tang of crisper acidity comes through."
"This wine is crisp and perhaps too full of acidity, giving it a red-currant character that is juicy and tightly fruity. It needs to soften over the next few years. Try again from 2020."
"This wine's rubbery, leafy berry aromas are forced and strained. Its raw, choppy palate tastes of peppery currant and plum, while its tight and narrow finish tastes a touch green."
"This Oregon winery consistently makes solid, affordable Pinot Gris. The new vintage seems a bit subdued and perhaps needs more bottle age to fully open up. Thin apple fruit and a hint of celery come through, with yeasty accents on the finish."
"Traces of yellow peach mingle into fresh herbs and green plums in this delicately concentrated Pinot Grigio. Medium bodied in style, with soft, yielding acidity, it's a quiet but pleasing wine."
"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling is a good stab at lesser ripe fruit from Temecula, although the aromas are still very primary, with Concord grape and grape seed most prominent. Black-fruit flavors meet with black licorice and clove on the palate."
"This blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon has a resiny aroma ont the nose. The palate boasts lemony acidity, with vanilla, tobacco and currant flavors, while the finish is choppy and tangy."
"Lush and accessible aromas of ripe cherries, strawberries, lilacs and cigar box show on the boisterous nose of this bottling. The palate is a bit more simple, with dark red fruit, sandalwood, a hint of star anise and a purple-flower flavor that's a bit over the top."
"Raspberry aromas are mild on the nose. This hails from Bellmunt, a warm, lower-lying section of the Priorat. In the mouth, it's rough and gritty, with narrow plum and cherry flavors."
"This sparkling red wine has aromas of raspberry, cassis and sweet cherry pie. The palate brings flavors of black currant and cherry juice, with a slightly sweet finish."
"From a high-elevation site, this wine opens mildly before a fierce grip of tannin and power take hold. Sticky black fruit, cedar and somewhat harsh tannins give it a brawny rustic quality."
"This is a plush, rustic and somewhat impenetrable wine in terms of tannins and ripeness. It offers a strong taste of tobacco, leather, earth and dried fruit."
This opens with delicate aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit. The simple palate offers blackberry jam and a star-anise note alongside easygoing tannins. Drink now.
Hints of clay and spice lend savoriness to sweet-tart apple and pear in this value icewine made from a blend of Ortega and Optima grapes. It's slightly cloying in sweetness but a straightforward dessert option. Drink now.
Vivid celery aromas and flavors ride a moderately crisp texture in this medium-bodied wine before a hint of sweetness completes the picture.
"There's a slight effervescence to this bottling, which shows fresh banana, mango, wet stone and a subtle yeast on the nose. There is decent energy to the palate, where the tightly wound flavors of lemon juice and chalk arise."
"This wine has a distinctly strong element of cured meat and salami on the nose, before it lunges wholeheartedly into chocolate, cedar and tobacco tones. Soft significant tannins wrap around the flavors in an impenetrable way."
"Aromas suggest tilled soil and black-skinned fruit. The easygoing, simple palate presents clove, orange zest and red-skinned berry alongside rounded tannins. Drink soon."
"With the alcohol barely topping 12%, this might have made a better ros than full-fledged Pinot Noir. Its strawberry and citrus flavors are dilute, though clean and fresh. High, citrusy acidity is the prominent characteristic."
"Oak-derived aromas of clove and charred berry fruits are the first act in this unusual Malbec-Carmenre blend. Its weighty palate delivers high acidity and rough tannins. Short, choppy plum and leafy flavors feel pointy on the finish."
"This wine is slightly spritzy, with forward flavors of strawberry soda pop. It drinks like a much less expensive bottle and should be consumed chillednow through 2019."
"Dusty, dried black fruit aromas lead the way in this astringent, oaky wine. Its barrel flavors, from aging in 30% new American oak, suggest raw lumber rather than pretty toast. More bottle age may help smooth it out."
"Dry herbal aromas of oregano and thyme dominate the nose of this minty, spicy Cabernet. The palate has a raw exterior, without much stuffing, tasting of coffee grounds, fennel, cured meats and spiced cherry. Dryness is the overriding theme here."
"This wine's spicy plum and berry aromas lose freshness quickly with air and turn mulchy. It's chunky and acidic, with saturated plum and berry flavors and a loud-ringing finish."
"This opens with subdued aromas of scorched earth, baking spice and black-skinned berry. The simple palate offers dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of clove. It's easygoing, with soft tannins."
"Situated in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers, this estate, one of several owned by the Ducourt family, has made an easy, crisp blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Smillon. Acidity and touch of herbal flavors are balanced by the tropical edge that comes from the vintage. Drink the wine now."
"Like a sampler box of chocolates, this label of D'Arenberg blends four Spanish and Portuguese varieties: Tempranillo, Grenache, Tinta Co and Souzo. Unfortunately 2011 was one of South Australia's toughest vintages on record and this wine doesn't quite make the grade. It's dense and oaky, with barely ripe plum, raspberry and vegetal notes. The palate offers some juicy fruit and the tannins are powerful and drying."
"This wine's spicy blueberry and plum aromas are scattershot and unfocused. It's a wiry, high-acid Malbec with plum, currant and herb flavors. A high-toned and front-loaded, it fades quickly on the finish."
This wine is packed with fruit flavors and has a lightly tannic texture to carry them along. Focused raspberry and sour-cherry notes are accented by dashes of wood smoke and pepper.
"Light aromas of mowed lawn, ripe peach and wet concrete show on the mellow nose of this bottling. It's fairly simple on the palate, with ripe pear and seared lime flavors."
"A heavy coating of resiny oak sits on top of reedy berry fruit aromas. Reduction and jamminess offset each other on a tight palate, while there's a prickly, slightly herbal quality to the plum and berry flavors in this Monastrell."
"Plum, baking spice and licorice aromas lead to lightly styled fruit flavors in this wine. The wood influence seems quite intense, distracting from the fruit."
"Herbal aromas announce the 100% Sauvignon Blanc in this wine. It is crisp, although touches of tropical fruit and citrus bring out the Bordeaux origins. Drink this fruity wine now."
"Though this cuve is far more limited (and expensive) than the winery's regular release, it's imbued with strong coffee and vanilla flavors that overwhelm the fruit. Its tannins are hard and the fruit rather generic. Another year or two in bottle may bring it into better balance."
"This wine's stewy, herbal berry aromas are not very ripe or compelling. Its rough palate offers minty, herbal berry and carob flavors, finishing slightly hot and abrasive, with green notes."
"A heavy obvious oak component meets good ripe fruit flavors in this full-bodied mouth-filling wine. The aromas are charred and smoky, leading to almost jammy blackberry flavors."
"This combines grapes from St. Helena and Yountville appellations, as well as 15% Petite Sirah. Dull on the nose, it has an herbal persistence of cedar and sage backed by plenty of tannin and planks of oak."
"Green, grassy aromas announce a wine with ripeness issues. In the mouth, this feels raw and tannic, with hard-pumping acidity. Oaky, chocolaty flavors accent plum and berry fruit, while this feels and tastes riper on the finish than it does early on."
"This wine's lightly volatile black fruit and baking spice aromas lead to dark fruit flavors backed by firm, grippy tannins. It doesn't all come together, and the variety seems lost."
"Made entirely from the Xarello grape, this brut smells is mildly funky on the nose. A solid palate holds briny peach and bready flavors, while this is steady on the moderately complex finish."
"This wine's lightly ripened fruit flavors suggest pear flesh and pear skin. There's not much to it, other than a touch of orange candy as it fades away."
"This soft, rich wine is a delicious reminder of the great fruit in this vintage. It has broad red fruits with balanced acidity and a crisp edge. This wine that comes from vineyards at the southern end of the Cte de Beaune is ready to drink now."
"Pear skin scents and flavor highlights accompany the straight-ahead pear fruit in this wine. There's some residual sugar, which rounds out the mouthfeel and keeps the alcohol low. Drink up."
"Apple cider aromas set up a tight palate with moderate acidity. This tastes briny and mildly bitter, with grassy white-peach flavors. On the finish, this doesn't change much or improve."
"This aromatic wine exudes smoky spicy oaky aromas that continue on the palate, joining good cherry and blackberry flavors and mingling on a smooth texture. It's overtly oaky but has enough fruit to provide counterbalance."
"White peach, caramel and browned butter aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is soft and easy with flavors of roasted apple and cinnamon, though it could use a more acidic boost."
"On the nose, this Malbec blend is heavily oaked and smells like latex and plastic. On the chewy, tannic palate, it tastes largely of burnt oak and gummy berry fruits. Heat and chocolate flavors drive the finish."
"Aromas of baking spice and black-skinned fruit lead the nose while the palate offers clove and black-cherry jam. It's easygoing, with round tannins."
"Aromas of cedar, baking spice and mocha lead the way while the simple palate delivers prune, coffee and a hint of clove. It's already accessible, with pliable tannins."
"This wine's light cranberry fruit suggests that the grapes were barely ripe or perhaps sourced from young vines. The flavors are pretty but quickly dissipate, leaving residual tastes of stem and bitter herb. Give this another year or two of bottle age."
"This brut is sound on the palate, but low acidity results in a flat sensation. White-fruit and green melon flavors are lightly oxidized on a yeasty finish."
"This wine, from unspecified sources, drinks like a less expensive Cabernet. It's chewy and rustic, dominated by vanilla scents and flavors and finishes with hints of black tea."
"Light orange in color, this wine brings sweet cherry and herb aromas. It drinks dry, with broad, fat-feeling but lightly concentrated fruit flavors."
"Green, leafy aromas accent this wine's generic berry notes. Its raw, pinched palate is dry and tannic, tasting of minty green herbs and berry fruit. Acidity and leafy flavors are at the forefront of its herbal finish."
"Soy sauce, grilled meat, red plum and currant aromas give an impression of underrripeness in this wine. It feels linear, with no give to the palate, and its savory, herbal berry flavors dry out on the finish."
"Aromas of fresh pumpkin and dusty peach are clean but bland on the nose. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Airen shows briny melon flavors, with notes of spent yeast and wheat on a low-acid finish."
"This wine is spicy, with a bitter edge that hides some of the fruit. It does have a citrus character followed with acidity, giving the wine the potential of a fruity future. Wait until mid 2018."
"Light aromas of white fruit greet the nose in this Chardonnay from red-wine country. The plump palate is simple and low on acid, while this tastes of lightly oaked melon and apple."
"This is a light wine with red-currant fruitiness and a crisp texture. It has a light tannin edge as well as juicy acidity, bright and fruity at the end. Drink from late 2018."
"This medium-bodied wine could pass for a cherry cola, with its fruity aroma, rather tart balance and flavors like cinnamon and cola."
"This smooth wine has a soft texture, candylike fruit flavors and an earthy element that stretches from the first whiff to the lingering finish."
"A gold color and round melony aromas are friendly on the nose. Dry apple flavors are lightly oxidized, while this isn't offering much on the finish."
Sweet berry-cherry flavors meet a fleshy rounded midpalate in this simple and easygoing red that has a substantial taste of dried fruit and leather.
"Tart berry flavors bordering on sour show in this wine, with unripe cherry notes mixed in. Aged a year in neutral barrels, it offers a faint suggestion of mocha as it fades."
"Subtle aromas of baked earth and pomegranate are very shy on the nose of this bottling. A slightly tart red-currant flavors pops on the sip, along with a touch of cinnamon."
"Roasted campfire and herbal blueberry aromas lead the nose of this wine. The palate lacks substance and structure. Its herbal, oaky berry flavors are green and stewy, finishing with unabsorbed oak and mint notes."
"This is from a site 2,000-feet high in elevation, and made in tiny amounts. It opens with a massive concentration of plum and up-front tannin, imparting heady oak aromas and power. The finish is simple and bright in cassis."
"This wine's scratchy plum and tomato aromas lead to a slightly creamy palate. Its salty plum and berry flavors are raw and a touch green, finishing short and flat."
"This wine is citrus-driven on the nose, leading to a streamlined palate of apple, green melon and almond skin flavors."
"Berry and plum scents suggest powdered drink mix. A narrow palate feels austere, while this tastes of tart black plum with mineral tones. On the finish, this dries out quickly as it leaves grating residual tannins."
"This wine pops with notes of ripe strawberry, cherry, herb and melon aromas. These notes carry to the palate, yet are restrained, and the tannins bring grittiness."
"This wine's sugar beet and raspberry aromas are reedy like sweet grass. It dries out quickly on the palate due to rubbery tannins. Herbal berry flavors fill it out, feeling slightly astringent and begging for food."
"This crisp, fruity wine by a Chablis-based producer comes from northern Burgundy. Shining acidity and fresh citrus flavors give an easy, ready-to-drink wine."
"This tastes off-dry, yet that sweet fruit doesn't quite mask a bitterness that lingers through the finish. The light pear and pear skin flavors seem like an afterthought."
"This wine's dark fruit aromas are neither complex nor serious. It's a basic Malbec, soft and a bit overweight, with generic black fruit flavors and a hint of blackened toast on an otherwise innocuous finish."
"A blend of 63% Sangiovese, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this wine tastes slightly overripe, with a candied nose of rustic fruit and thick heated tannins."
"Scented with spice and built on thick, grainy tannins, this wine offers little varietal character. The dilute red fruit could be almost anything from anywhere."
"Spicy, peppery, herbal berry and plum aromas lead the way in this wine. It's dry as a bone and tannic, with woody plum and tomato flavors, finishing oaky and a bit salad-like."
"This is a fairly green and astringent wine, with full-bodied concentration and thick tannin."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec has raw berry aromas. It's generic on the palate, with berry and tomato flavors and little depth or breadth. It has a lightly herbal, inoffensive finish."
This Viognier/Marsanne blend from southern Oregon is perfumed almost to a fault. Its light citrus fruit is overpowered by floral baby powder scents and flavors.
"This vineyard designate must have stood out during the winemaking process, but at the moment its better qualities seem to be hiding. Neither place nor variety show with any particularity; it's just a light, generic red wine."
"A few wineries in the Pacific Northwest are experimenting with this Portuguese grape. Here, it just tastes like a thin, generic red, and the fruit is buried in aggressive just-sawn wood flavors from aging in 30% new American oak."
"Jammy black currant aromas are rooty and medicinal. This young Tempranillo is hard and smacking on the palate. A forced-oak flavor of clove is dominant, while this is drying and raw on the finish."
"This tan-colored brut nature opens with yeasty aromas of brioche and oxidized apple. A foamy palate lacks clarity and smoothness, while this tastes like it smells: briny, yeasty and mildly oxidized. A fruitless finish is simply dry and bready."
This wine has a grip to it that hits hard on the palatea somewhat astringent turn to the tannins. Red fruit and violet work hard to integrate within a full-bodied concentration.
"Merlot makes up half of this wine, and Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Petit Verdot make up the balance. The aromas are unique, with high-toned black tea, green herb and vanilla notes that aren't entirely settled. The palate brings blackberry and plum flavors that are a bit disjointed. It drops off on the finish."
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and cherry-jam flavors dress up this bright, pleasant and rather light-bodied wine."
"This has evolved aromas of prune and tilled soil. The warm, simple palate shows fleshy black plum, vanilla and a candied almond note alongside pliant tannins. You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol. Drink soon."
"This wine's stewy, medicinal plum aromas are chunky. In the mouth, it's plump and bouncy, lacking spine. It concludes with tea and stewed berry flavors on a drawing, hefty finish."
"This wine is smooth and soft, with a gently juicy character. Its fruit and attractive acidity make for a generous wine that is ready to drink."
"White-fruit aromas are quiet on the nose. Despite a shearing mouthfeel that's typical for Txakoli, the palate leans sour and citric in feel."
"Produced from Chardonnay grown in the Beaujolais region, part of a greater Bourgogne appellation launched in 2012, this is a soft and fruity wine. It has a tang of lemon acidity, a creamy texture and a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink this easygoing wine now."
"This is scented with an odd mix of mint and bubblegum, and those flavors continue onto the palate. It's a candy-like wine with a sugary finish."
"Rough and grainy, this is a tannic, earthy wine with a bit of rustic charm. It's not typical of the grape variety but could stand up to a burger and fries. Drink soon."
"Syrupy oak flavors dominate modest fruit notes in this medium-bodied, ripe and almost sweet wine. Tart cherry and raspberry flavors underneath give some fruity support."
"Softly tannic, this is a simple juicy wine, lightly ripe in blackberry and black currant. Secondary flavors come to the fore in the midpalate, dipped in milk chocolate and soy."
"Don't look for any familiar Pinotage character in this wine. It's a thin, nondescript, lightly peppery red with a whiff of chocolate."
"This wine's aromas are light, with herb and spice notes. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with lemony fruit flavors and no apparent new oak influence."
This is a blend of two barrels and it contains a strong lingering notion of cured meat and Italian delicatessen. Thick green tannins spark ongoing flavors of cedar and tobacco within a full-bodied concentrated package.
"Fans of old-school Cabernet Franc might also like this leafy, grilled-smelling Cabernet Sauvignon. Its tannic, abrasive palate holds spicy plum flavors that finish mildly green."
"It's difficult to review wines that show significant bottle variation, like this one from Vista Hills. Here, the first example had a leathery dryness that killed any impression of fresh fruit, with a final glue-like note. The second bottle was better, with raspberry fruit and none of the tack room scents and flavors of the first. But bitter phenolics and drying tannins suggest it should be consumed soon."
"Aromas of stone fruit, apple and pumpkin announce a palate that's dilute but holding onto some punch. Briny citrus flavors suggest orange peel, while this blend of Palomino and Torronts tastes slightly bitter on the finish."
"Still tight, this offers pomegranate and not quite ripe raspberry fruit. It's a thin, acidic wine, which may have been overcropped or picked too early. It might have made a nice ros."
"This Cava shows a citric palate, with notes of celery and lime. The finish is mild and short on a crisp mineral note."
"This is yet another unconventional and unsuccessful wine from Casarena. Its wild, oaky aromas are harsh, chemical and herbal. Its tight, drawing palate is framed by green, oaky flavors."
This blend of Garhacha Blanca and Viognier is round in feel. Briny nectarine and citrus flavors are sharp on the palate and turn green on the finish.
"This fruity wine, a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, is stalky with light tannins and plenty of black-currant fruits. Crisp and with acidity to balance the fruitiness, it is ready to drink."
"Straw colored in the glass, this sparkling wine has aromas of green apple and yeasty bread. In the mouth it has flavors of apple and white peach with a very bubbly finish."
"A blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petit Verdot, this wine is robust and brawny in tobacco leaf, bitterroot and an intensity of tannin. The majority grape contributes savory bites of cigar and leather."
"With only 5% of Pinot Noir in the blend, this is essentially a ripe, cherry-flavored Gamay. As such it is fruity, soft in the tannins and bright with acidity. Made to be drunk young, it is ready now."
"This strawberry-flavored wine offers attractive light fruits and acidity. Forward and fruity, it's a simple Pinot Noir with an easygoing character. Drink from late 2018."
"This is a lightly ripe wine, possessed of pungent compost, black tea, sandalwood and mushroom aromas that follow through on the palate. The end is simple and tannic."
"Smoke, red cherry and a hint of rubber show on the nose of this bottling. There is a tangy black-plum flavor on the palate, with hints of dried chile pepper and beef jerky."
"As this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Merlot opens, its floral raspberry aromas seem soapy and artificial. Its lean palate is acidic, with salty raspberry and red plum flavors that carry into the lightweight finish."
"Disparate aromas of chocolate, herbal black fruits, stalky field greens and animal fur just barely pull it together. In the mouth, this is highly acidic, with salty, tart plum and berry flavors."
"This wine's grassy aromas include a note of green tobacco. Its full, chewy palate turns rubbery and jammy the longer it sits. Generic black-fruit and oak-based flavors dominate, while its chocolate-tinged finish is thick with tannins."
Apple and apricot aromas lead to a simple but healthy palate. Stone fruit and citrus flavors are ample but flatten out on a low-acid finish.
"Mild stone-fruit aromas are quiet on the nose. This feels plump on the palate, with dry citrus flavors that are a touch green and bitter."
"This opens with light aromas of ripe black plum, toast and a whiff of baking spice. The extremely simple palate shows prune, cinnamon and a hint of cocoa alongside flexible tannins."
"Mild fruit tones hide behind yeasty aromas. Plump in feel yet not overly intense, the palate deals briny flavors of almond skin, peach pit and melon. On the finish, this lingers with a hint of salt."
"Deep apricot in the glass, this wine features aromas of grapefruit and guava. Made in an off-dry style, it is refreshingly sweet, with flavors of peach, apricot and honeysuckle and a tangy finish."
"Quite oaky in style, this wine starts with menthol and charred-wood aromas followed by flavors like smoked meat and marinated black cherries. It has full body and a thick texture that helps it cling to the palate."
"Apricot and carrot aromas show on the nose. This aging Albario is pulpy and round in feel, with prickly flavors of melon, bell pepper and bitter pyrazines."
"An assertive butter and spice overlay makes this otherwise lean wine a little off-balance, but it's not hard to enjoy the vanilla and cedar aromas and crisp spare fruit flavors."
"This light to medium-bodied wine has a piney aroma, light cherry and blueberry flavors and very soft tannins. It's a pleasant, pop style of wine with a suggestion of sweetness."
"Restrained aromas recall baking spice and dried dark-skinned fruit. Mirroring the nose, the simple palate offers prune, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside astringent tannins."
"This wine's black color and concentrated currant and blackberry aromas lead to a palate with a modest volatility issue. Its stewy, herbal berry flavors are clunky and finish with a latent note of bacon."
"Thin blueberry and other blue fruit flavors are in evidence here, but they're quickly overshadowed by drying, tea leaf flavors. The aggressive tannins may be due in large part to aging in 30% new American oak."
"Mulberry and blackberry fruit combine nicely in this wine, but it doesn't quite come together. There are disparate threads of tannin and acid, a hint of plastic and some residual bitterness on the finish."
"Casarena's wines are always unique, for better or worse. This Malbec's earthy aromas of stewed berries and Hoison sauce are funky. It's narrow and raw, with herbal flavors of juniper, eucalyptus and overripe blueberry. On the finish, it lacks structure."
"This wine's stalky berry aromas bring its ripeness into question. Fairly hard on the palate, it offers creamy oak and salty berry fruit, finishing flat due to low acidity."
"This wine's peach Jolly Rancher and white flower aromas lead to lightly sprizty, off-dry stone fruit flavors. It shows a good bit of heat on the finish, throwing the balance out of whack."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec has raw, herbal licorice root and red plum aromas that fall short of ripe. In the mouth, it's grippy and rough, with minty roasted plum flavors that plod into the finish."
"Funky aromas of bath soap, sugar beets and spiced berry fruits lead the nose of this wine. Although the palate is grating, it delivers interesting spiced fruit and rhubarb flavors. Burnt notes rise up on the finish, recalling the texture of grape skins."
"This has a funky edge to the aroma, which carries over into the somewhat leathery flavor. The fruit seems to reflect a mix of underripe and overripe grapes."
"A yeasty, floral aroma leads the nose. This dilute Viura has little substance on the palate, while bland flavors of white fruits finish yeasty and slightly briny on a hint of melon."
"This wine is still lean, with more tannins than fruit. Its dry character gives an edge of bitterness that is not quite counterbalanced by the red-currant fruits. The dryness may well remain."
"This thin, weedy wine offers hints of rhubarb but nothing else in the way of fruit. Its tannins are stiff and earthy."
"Slightly pyrazinic aromas are green and gruff. The palate is simple and streamlined, with flavors of melon and peach. A briny tasting finish closes out this standard Viura."
"Aromas of lanolin and citrus peel lead on the nose. The medium-bodied palate holds a bitter flavor of stone-fruit pit that leads to a clean, short finish."
"This wine shows an extracted palate with flavors of raisin and toast, while tartaric acidity creates a fiery finish with a grapy aftertaste."
Creamy aromas of apple and candy corn show on the nose. Flavors of citrus fruit carry the streamlined palate.
"A light rusty color and herbal red fruit, tomato and spice aromas announce this rough and tumble Malbec-Cabernet blend. Especially tannic at the edges, it tastes peppery, dry and heavily spiced. Its short finish stifles any ripe fruit."
Candied cherry and charred oak flavors tumble through this jazzed up medium-bodied wine along with cherry-syrup flavors and a candied impression on the finish.
This thick-textured wine has light melon aromas and muted fig flavors. It feels full bodied and emphasizes an oily mouthfeel.
A smoky dried-meat aroma and rich fruit flavors make a bit of an unusual combination in this medium-bodied smooth-textured wine. It has an element of oak spice and a hint of sweetness too.
"Red-berry aromas control the nose of this hard-pounding Malbec. Its oversized palate is built on high acidity and hard tannins, with loud berry and plum flavors. Dry on the finish, its fruit disappears quickly."
"Wet concrete and Anjou pear rinds show on the nose of this bottling. Ripe apple flavors and cut green grass show on the sip, where the flavors are a bit wild and sporadic."
"This wine's wood spice, Mounds bar and coconut aromas also include notes of acetone. Woody flavors dominate the palate and persist on the finish. The oak obscures the fruit."
"Baked red cherry, brown spice, wet gravel and sweet vanilla show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors trend toward muddy clay, bay leaf and light red currant."
"The aromas don't seem entirely harmonious in this young wine, bringing herb, glue and light volatile notes. The red fruit and floral flavors are light, simple and not fully integrated."
"This wine shows prominent volatile acidity, which overpowers its red apple, cherry and baking spice aromas. The palate has lightly styled, smooth-feeling plum flavors backed by astringent tannins."
"Really flat on the nose, this shows aromas of black cherry and cedar. The palate offers bland cherry and blackberry fruit with a hint of pepper and leather."
"This offers raw, lean earthy red berry aromas. It's a light-bodied and fresh Malbec, with herbal red fruit flavors. Its drawing finish tastes of herbal red fruits and plum skins."
"Aromas of vanilla, yeast and frosted doughnut are slightly grassy and green. This Verdejo-based sparkler from Rueda is more wine-like than bubbly. Underripe nectarine and white-grape flavors are yeasty, while this tastes of white bread on a finish that lacks fruit and complexity."
"This wine's plain apple fruit comes with an off-putting leathery flavor, which is odd given it's sealed with screwcap. The finish is short and bitter."
"A soapy scent of cleanser combines with this wine's basic berry and mint aromas. In the mouth, it's raw, choppy and tannic, with herbal berry flavors that finish peppery and a touch green."
"This is a leathery wine, a bit thick yet soft in texture, with a full-bodied ripeness of cherry and oaky vanilla."
"A neutral nose shows a briny streak, while this feels acidic on the palate. This blend of Treixadura and Godello shows white-fruit flavors, with a wheaty tasting finish."
"Prickly, fairly green aromas suggest cactus and citrus. A punchy, citric mouthfeel is lean, while this Viura tastes of lime and thyme."
"Plush and round, this is a simple wine, offering ripe flavors of melon, sweet pear and green olive."
"This wine is a bit flat in black fruit and moderate structure,. It is soft and round but lacking somewhat in varietal character."
"This wine feels alive due to typical Txakoli acidity, but there isn't much body or structure to it. Tart green-apple flavors are waxy and inexact."
"Charred cedar, peppercorn and hints of pasilla and ancho chiles show on the nose of this bottling. The pyrazine-powered chile-pepper flavor is very strong on the sip, ranging from crushed green peppercorns to mole sauce, set against a background of plum, boysenberry and coffee."
"Aromas of white fruits, oak and grape skins are mild on the nose. A resiny, sticky palate leads to ripe white-fruit flavors that are oak-covered. Low acidity and heavy oak on the finish make for a cloying end."
"Bold berry aromas suggest full ripeness and a certain level of ease. In the mouth, however, this feels heavy. Grapy flavors of blackened berry fruits finish chunky and with little energy."
"This wine offers an herbaceous nose of dusty gravel, bell pepper and thick black cherry, the body somewhat thin and simple in structure. The tannins pierce through on the finish."
"Beefy in body and also in flavor, this full-bodied wine brings aromas like singed rosemary and flavors like maraschino cherries and barbecue sauce. It has moderate tannins for a grippy mouthfeel."
"Highly aromatic on the nose, notes of flowers and soap carry the lead. In the mouth, this is oily in feel yet with a strong vein of acidity. A quick blast of lychee flavor finishes short and bitter."
"Soft and semi sweet, this wine has jammy, cherry-candy flavors and a smooth texture accompanied by moderate tannins."
"The color of this winean almost golden yellowseems to suggest some oxygen exposure given its youth. The aromas bring corn on the cob and spice notes, leading to a lightly creamy palate that falls flat on the finish."
"This is 100% varietal. It was given time in oak for two years in a combination of French and American barrels. A sweetness from the oak is noticeable, as a taste of root beer combines with juicy blackberry, the fruit ripe and round."
"The white wines in the Wine by Joe portfolio are fresh and well-made and offer exceptional value. This budget Pinot Noir tries hard but offers in-your-face vanilla and cola flavors, suggesting some sort of oak chip treatment. There's plenty of flavor here, but not much Pinot Noir character."
"A yellow color with luster announces maturity in this Chardonnay, while flat aromas of spiced pumpkin and melon are mellow. Mature, lightly oxidized flavors of salted corn, apple and squash are preserved on the finish by moderate acidity."
"A nose of yeast, salami and overripe white fruits leads to a round palate with little vitality or energy. Yeasty stone-fruit flavors become shaky on a low-acid finish."
"Aromas of herbs, lemon and blueberry show a bramble and green character on the nose. This is a minty Petit Verdot that's been padded with a lot of oak. The end result is a mix of woody flavors that are bitter and finish like mint-infused coffee."
"This is a simplistic wine driven by citrus and green, stalky flavors. The palate lacks precision and finishes on a slightly bitter note."
"This wine tilts heavily toward extremely oaky aromas and flavors that have a smoky, concocted flavor and nearly overpower any fruit components that might be underneath."
"Scratchy, reedy aromas of berry fruits, oak grain and green herbs show on the nose. This Garnacha is pulling and narrow on a rubbery, tart palate. Sour plum and berry flavors fail to come around on a raw finish."
"This is beyond light; it's almost invisible. Some hints of cola, bark and tannin come through on the palate, with plenty of astringency. But where's the fruit?"
"Dusty aromas of tropical fruits and melon are ample on the nose. This varietal Albillo, a grape that's rarely seen, feels round but amorphous. Salty, bitter flavors of pineapple and pyrazines leave nothing but mild bitterness on the finish."
"Not much from this label has been encouraging, this raw, raspy Cabernet included. It leads with underripe aromas and follows with reedy, lightly green plum flavors."
"This entry-level wine has green aromas on the nose, while the palate is pinched and tannic. Jammy berry fruit flavors blended with green-herb notes and rough tannins."
"Soapy stone-fruit aromas are yeasty on the nose. This is foamy on the palate, with vinegar-like acidity. Mealy peach and apple flavors are bitter on the finish."
This is a hugely extracted wine that traffics in earthy mushroom and a streak of greenness that comes off as somewhat disjointed and harsh.
"This is a mature, ready-to-drink wine with a brownish tinge in the color, and an aged aroma like cola and cedar with a touch of barnyard. The flavors are earthy and rather lean."
"Medicinal aromas of latex blend with creamy, candied berry notes in this wine. The palate feels jammy and wide, lacking focus. Cheesy oak and berry fruit flavors are herbal and tomatoey through the finish."
Yeasty aromas of corn and saline water lead to a briny palate of white-fruit flavors. This is low in intensity and wobbly in stature. Drink now.
"A mulchy nose with stalky aromas gets this off to a shaky start. It's light on the palate, with a mix of woody and bitter flavors. Overall, it has a decent mouthfeel but lacks substantial aromas and flavors."
"This nonvintage cuve incorporates grapes from 2013 and 2014. It's dull tasting, flat and herbal, with a whiff of sweat. The tannins are potent and earthy."
"This wine shows lively acidity and the sensation of resiny oak, while flavors of salt, barrel spice and baked apple show on the finish."
"A nose driven by punchy pyrazine-based aromas is sweaty and not encouraging. Other than spunky acidity, the palate on this Sauvignon Blanc is dilute. Briny flavors are raw and green, while the finish is hollow and tangy."
"This wine is steeped in eucalyptus and bay leaf, with a floral aroma that's hard to pin down. Its structure somewhat flat."
"Stewed, mealy berry fruit aromas are lacking in clarity and quality. This Garnacha from a cool year feels lean and raw, while berry flavors are sour, weedy and devoid of ripeness. A scratchy, earthy tasting finish is not of help."
"This wine has a distinct metallic note, which distracts from its already light spice and apple aromas. The palate has an untoward gardenia note."
"This Garnacha smells like a smoldering campfire. A tannic, heavy, overoaked palate tastes mostly of burnt wood and hamburger, while a hint of bacon arises on an all-wood finish. This is not a well-balanced wine; it's too oaky, too heavy and just not good."
Aromas of lees and chemicals are mild on the nose. This Viura has an oily feel and a salty flavor profile that shows mild fruit tones.
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot is not entirely in balance. Its mix of oak, residual sugar and roasted plum flavors barely make it drinkable."
"At first, the palate on this Verdejo is spritzy, but then it goes flat. Chunky but dull white-fruit flavors give way to bitterness on the finish."
"This wine's grassy red fruit aromas border on weedy and show a streak of oak. It's far from ripe on the palate, with dilute red fruit flavors and oaky notes of clove and mint. Its hollow finish tastes more of clove than fruit."
"This Malvasia shows a narrow palate of salty, oxidized flavors. On the finish, this is bone-dry in feel."
"Briny aromas lead the nose. This feels tight on the palate, boasting a streamlined texture. Nutty, salty flavors are devoid of fruit, while this Macabeo (Viura) is briny and tastes like almond skins on the finish."
"This is beautully concentrated and full of great richness yet seems closed at the moment. Its apricot jelly and dried fruit flavors, acidity and botrytis are in perfect balance, developing intensity as it opens. A full, generous wine with a great future. Drink from 2023."
"Powered by intense botrytis, this wine is opulent and ripe, with spice, yellow fruit and honey flavors. It has just the right balance of acidity to maintain its shape and proportions. It's likely to age well over many years. Drink from 2024."
"This impressive wine has great intensity and superb apricot and orange flavors. Acidity mingles with its botrytis core and rich, concentrated fruit, striking a fine balance. It will become delicious as it matures. Drink from 2024."
"This ethereal Tokaji Asz is golden in color, with aromas of delicate acacia flower, honeysuckle, fresh peach and tinned apricot. The flavors come alive on the palate, showing luscious apricot, floral honeycomb and fresh pear juice. The acidity is perfectly balanced to prevent this delightful wine from being too cloying."
"The estate wine from Moucho is always a great wine. This latest release, almost black in color and five-years-old, is hugely rich, powered by black fruits and juicy acidity. Made principally from Alicante Bouschet, it shows the power and the aging potential of this variety in the Alentejo. This wine, foot-trodden in open stone lagars, is destined for much longer aging. Drink at the earliest in 2021."
"Here's another stunning offering from this fantastic estate. Elegant, structured and restrained, it opens with enticing Nebbiolo scents of blue flower, perfumed berry, dark spice and a light balsamic note of eucalyptus. The luminous palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, licorice and cinnamon while vibrant acidity and firm, polished tannins provide seamless support. Drink 20232043."
"With its apricot and honeyed flavors, this is a rich wine. It has intense, ripe fruit and layers of spice and botrytis. A dry core gives it its great richness and aging potential. Drink from 2024."
"This wine has great richness. Along with its spice and honey notes, there are orange and lemon fruit flavors that give it lift. Beautifully balanced and ripe, it has the potential to be a superb wine. The botrytis core is what gives it its great aging potential. Drink from 2024."
"A booming but expertly balanced wine, this blend of 54% Syrah, 18% Petite Sirah, 18% Zinfandel and 10% Grenache shows aromas of black currant, black olive, black cherry, sweet woody spice and powdered hot cocoa. Elegant mocha and cappuccino notes thrive on the palate, which is brightened by penetrating acidity. It boasts perfectly polished tannins and ripe fig flavors, with a flash of dark chocolate on the finish."
"Aromas of mature iris, blackberry, tobacco, crushed mint and baking spice lift out of the glass on this gorgeous Barolo. Despite the scorching heat, the Scavino made a supremely elegant wine, boasting black cherry, crushed black raspberry, menthol, star anise and ground clove framed in fine-grained, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. A gorgeous wine. Drink 20202031."
"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind."
"This bottling from the San Francisco-based producer is about as Burgundian as California gets. Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor."
"Intense and ripe, this is a superb wine from a top Sauternes estate. It has all the expected elements, including concentrated botrytis and honeyed flavors. Seville orange and lemon notes provide contrast, as does its acidity, which is just as intense as the honey character. It will age well, so drink from 2025."
"Straw colored with gold reflections, this delightful sweet wine has aromas of dried pear, fresh apricot and yellow peach. Flavors of fresh Bartlett pear, acacia honey and tinned apricots unfold on the palate. The finish is sweet, with just the right amount of acidity."
"One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character. It has intensity, a product of the aging in wood that has just concentrated the wine. Like all Ports of this type, it is ready to drink."
"This marks the debut of consulting winemaker Matthew Courtney's take on the estate site. It dazzles in complex notes of exotic Asian spice, lavender and crushed rock, while focused acidity provides a context of substance and depth."
"Noval, one of the showpiece estates of the Douro, releases vintages in most years. This wine gives a fine reflection of what is, in fact, a great vintage which was almost a general declaration. It is impressive, ripe with generous black fruits and a fine balance between the spirit and the rich structure and fruit. It is going to mature quickly in the sense that it can be drunk within the next five years. It will also age for several decades."
"This top wine from a major Cahors estate shows the potential of great Malbec. With its dense tannins, rich black fruit flavors, acidity and restrained power, it is a major force. Even with all its weight, it's stylish, complex and ageworthy wine. Drink from 2021."
"Since taking over a family estate in 1998, Cathy and Daniel Fourni have focused on making great wine with the help of their expert neighbors. This is the result. Produced from organic, low-yielding old vines and wood aged for nearly two years, the wine is concentrated and dense. Mint flavors show the new wood and give a polished edge to the black fruit. Powerful tannins and juicy acidity back up its fruitiness. This is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2023."
"This blend of Quinta del Mar and Drum Canyon vineyards makes for a very powerful and attention-demanding wine. Sultry aromas of roasted red cherry and caramelized berry meet with well-integrated clove and allspice on the potent nose. The palate explodes with ripe but acid-cut blackberry and raspberry syrup flavors, with thyme, star anise and more dark spices rounding out the power."
"Created as an homage to the traditional powerful black wines that set the reputation of Cahors in Medieval times, this wine follows the old practice of heating the grape must before fermentation. The result is enormous concentration, seriously tannic ripe black fruit and considerable acidity. These are all elements that demand aging, and even at four years old this wine is just starting out. Drink from 2021 at the earliest."
"Produced from old vines on the schist slopes of the upper Douro, this is an impressive wine from Carla Costa Ferreira and winemaker-daughter Rita Marques Ferreira. Dark tannins in this still-young wine bring out bitter chocolate flavors as well as enhancing the dense black fruits. Along with the rich structure and concentration, this superb wine has a sense of restrained authority and certainly the ability to age. Drink from 2021."
"This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg. A deep shade of mauve, the wine coats the glass and unleashes intense, lavish aromas of cassis, fig paste, mint and tarragon. It's as soft as it looks on the palate, where baked black cherry, roast beef, turned earth and lilac flavors ride luxurious yet firmly structured tannins."
"With a persistence of lightly-toasted oak, this youthful wine offers intense luxury. A gritty, stony texture complements its delicious aspects of lemon rind and anise. Green apple, ocean spray and an underlying streak of dried herb provide additional complexity and length."
A scent of French butter offers an immediate invitation to this excellent wine. Austerity on the palate gives way to a juicy core of invigorating tangerine and white peach flavors. The gravelly minerality on the midpalate finishes softly and with ease.
"Wound up aromas of blackberry, roasted beef, damp forest floor and balsamic reduction show on the muggy damp nose of this bottling by Ruben Solorzano. The palate is redolent with eucalyptus, pine, tarragon and fresh rosemary, proving herbal without being vegetal, thanks to a core of elderberry and polished tannins."
"What a fabulous vintage for this fragrant, radiant wine. Opening with alluring scents of iris, rose, culinary spice and perfumed berry, the focused palate delivers crushed strawberry, red cherry, cinnamon and star anise. It's loaded with finesse, thanks to firm ultrarefined tannins and bright acidity. Drink 20222033."
"The vineyards of this producer in the heart of Do, close to Viseu, the capital of the region. This generous wine with its powerful structure and rich texture from the fermentation in stone lagars, is shot through with ripe black plum and damson fruits as well as acidity. It should age further, so drink from 2019."
"Aromas of red berry, blue flower, menthol, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak take shape on this impeccably balanced radiant red. The palate is vibrant and focusedalmost etherealdelivering raspberry compote, Marasca cherry, star anise and cinnamon framed in elegant tannins. Weightless and loaded with finesse, it's an incredible result for what was a cool wet vintage in most of Italy. Drink through 2024."
"Dedicated to the current owner's late grandfather who founded the estate, this elegant red opens with alluring aromas of blue flower, dark spice, herbs and new leather. The savory palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, clove and licorice framed by polished tannins. It's already approachable, but will offer fantastic imbibing for another decade. Drink through 2027."
"Plump aromas of lemon mousse, meringue, wet limestone, white flowers and ripe key lime show on the nose of this excellent bottling. The palate bursts with flavors of cool cream, sea salt and lemon pith, set against a chalky texture. A mysteriously compelling experience."
"The top wine from Romaneira shows the power and the richness that can come from this property. Aging for 14 months in wood has just enhanced the opulent black fruits, ripe tannins and acidity. It is an impressive wine, made for aging and not likely to be ready until 2020."
"Ppa was the family's nickname for grandpa. The winery, run by grandson Stphane Ferreira, is the grandkids' tribute. This richly perfumed wine, by consultant Luis Pato, comes from a field blend of 21 grape varieties. Old vines with an average age of 82-years-old in a single parcel have given the wine huge concentration and rich swathes of tannins and black plum and damson fruit. The wine has power while also retaining plenty of elegance. It is an impressive wine, just approaching its peak and ready from 2018."
"Classic Nebbiolo aromas of wild berry, rose petal, baking spice and an earthy whiff of truffle emerge in the glass. The elegant vibrant palate mirrors the nose, delivering juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, pipe tobacco and cinnamon alongside firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. It's a textbook Barolo that will benefit from a few more years in the cellar. Drink 20232033."
"This wine is undeniably floral and voluptuous and hard to resist on the nose alone. Honeysuckle, lemon peel and flint tease and please around a focused core of oak and gritty texture of stone. Full bodied, it's lush and slightly reduceda compelling statement on power and grace."
"Combining 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, this wine has a depth of richness and focused, supportive acidity that work well to complement each other. Stone fruit, vanilla biscuit, cherry kirsch and green apple are all within the spectrum of flavors here, finishing with grace and a hint of spice."
"Beautiful in peach color, this blends 73% Chardonnay and 27% Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp, it tangles together vibrant flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry, as aromas of rose petal whisper by. A stony mineral component adds complexity and invitation to the texture."
"Fragrant blue flower, woodland berry, dark spice and pine forest aromas lead the way. It's racy, focused and loaded with chiseled finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, crushed cranberry, cinnamon and star anise. Tightly knit, refined tannins and firm acidity provide the backbone. Drink 20232033."
"This remarkable wine offers soft luxury between its balance of fresh red cherry and cassis and the velvety grip of tannic concentration. Spiky persistent acidity guides a freshness of forest floor, sage and tobacco, the power entirely graceful in the glass."
"Though still exploring the zesty acid-driven side of Pinot Noir, Marc Piro adds depth and richness to this bottling. Red cherry compote and cordial meet fennel, dill, tarragon and tapenade on the nose. The extremely lively and fresh palate unleashes an array of flower petals, just-pressed tart berries and Kalamata olives. A deep structure and thorough acidity complete the picture."
"Despite amazingly luscious aromas of star anise, stewed black cherry, black currant pie and coffee cake, this bottling still offers a prominent line of wet gravel and river stone minerality on the nose. Exotic mulberry and black cherry flavors ride atop the soft tannins and an underlying acidity, while white pepper dust and menthol unfold on the finish."
"Originating from a small, new producer based in the Napa Valley, this shows crushed stone and golden oak. Its essential succulence is that of high-toned citrus and apple kissed in caramel. A tease of lingering acidity makes it undeniably fresh and deliciously crisp."
"Gorgeous and smooth, this elegant, 10-year-old red boasts aromas of new leather, tilled soil and pipe tobacco. The polished and structured palate delivers creamy black cherry, star anise and clove framed in refined tannins. It's a remarkable performance for what was an extremely hot vintage. Best through 2023."
"What a rare, complex and spectacular wine. Well-aged and fortified wines like this are uncommon in California but this full-bodied and very sweet example proves it's possible.

The mouthfeel is lavish and full, enabling a wonderful finish that lasts for minutes."
"Classic Sangiovese aromas of new leather, wild berry, baking spice and a whiff of menthol lead the way on this full-bodied red. It's juicy and delicious, delivering crushed raspberry, fleshy black cherry, cinnamon and pipe tobacco framed in polished and velvety tannins. Drink now through 2027."
"Valdivieso's nonvintage mystery blend is always one of Chile's most curious wines, and #16 happens to be superb. An opening of rich black-cherry aromas tips towards spice cake with raisins. A lush, saturated palate holds delicious flavors of chocolaty black fruits, while on the finish a dark smokiness takes over. Drink now2023."
"This is a stunning Pinot Noir, especially from a Syrah-focused winery.

"This vintage is the first that was under complete control of winemaker Tyler Thomas, and his studious touch shows magically. There's a powerful density of ripe but not sweet black fruit on the nose of this bottling, along with hints of violets, turned earth and leather. The structure is firm, dense and chalky but with a vivid acidity, offering ethereal, supple flavors of black currant and cocoa on the finish. Drink 20182034."
"Made entirely from the famous vineyard named for its stony soils, this resplendent wine is powerfully crafted and bold. Coconut shavings and chocolate provide a luxurious flavor profile that meshes perfectly with the wine's lush grip of tannin and velvety mouthfeel. Dark cherry and cassis round out the flavors, accented in black pepper and clove."
"The very intriguing nose of this bottling by a winery that explores all types of Pinot Noir sites and styles shows sarsaparilla, sandalwood, incense and fresh boysenberry aromas. The palate is all about freshness, with blackberry and black raspberry flavors lifted by anise, peppercorns and wild thyme. Great depth and verve throughout."
"This is a structured, substantial wine, grippy on the palate, with firm-grained tannin and smoky oak. Mouth-filling with a juicy sophisticated core of cherry, blackberry and black currant, there's a defiant meatiness to the fruit, spiked in clove, black pepper and tobacco. Cellar through 2033."
"Crisp acidity buoys sharp red fruit in this delectable winea blend of multiple sites across the appellation. Medium build, it shows youthful tannins and oak that supports without intrusion, allowing the crunch of cranberry, strawberry and pomegranate to speak forcefully."
"The Serrano Mira family has been producing wine at this estate since 1667. The old-vines blend of four grapes (including Petit Verdot) is a rich testament to this legacya powerful wine that is impressively full, concentrated and dark. Despite its high alcohol, it is stylish, balancing swathes of ripe fruit with acidity and poised tannins. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."

It's light and bright on the palate, yet bolstered by strong and persistently grippy tannins, allowing rose petal and light violet flavors to shine atop the structure."
"Spicy, briary cassis and wild berry aromas come with notes of mountain herbs. As per usual, Casa Real 2013 is in great shape; the palate is lush and cushioned but stern and balanced. Spicy cassis, plum and oaky flavors finish with a mix of wood spice and dried-fruit notes. Drink through 2026."
"Leather, licorice and balsamic aromas slowly take shape in the glass. Full bodied and taut, this delivers dried black cherry, mature raspberry, star anise and clove set against fresh acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 20232043."
"A project of Master Sommelier Geoff Kruth with the assistance of winemaker Megan Glaab of Ryme Cellars, this is a light beguiling take on the famous appellation's most famous varietyone wrapped in crisp crunchy red fruit and floral aromatics of rose. Dried cherry highlights tight focused acidity and soft delicate layers of silky texture for a satisfying combination of elegance and quiet oak."
"This sweet and vibrant wine is a rare find. Wonderful floral, grapefruit and honey aromas lead to incredibly concentrated ripe flavors on a lush texture that's lifted by underlying acidity. It's almost irresistible now, but will be best after 2022."
"Bountiful and rich black fruits of black currant and black cherry meet with dark clove and other baking spices as well as a hint of maple on the nose of this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvdre blend. The palate's chalky structure is soft, allowing strong spice to rise amidst the black fruit in the midpalate, followed by a wave of plummy purple-flower flavors. The finish is all acid, which makes for a compelling combo of sensations."
"This is a well-composed and memorable wine. It offers a wealth of complexity in dusty graphite and black cherry, teased by wisps of soy and tobacco. The finish shows spicy clove that lasts for days."
"Toasted sandalwood, hints of sagebrush, crushed pencils, tart cranberry and vanilla brioche show on the nose of this bottling. The tannic structure is light but shows structure and tension, with rich flavors of cherry, cola, vanilla and clove."
"Fresh aromas of carnation, framboise, cherry cola and blooming rose petals show on the nose of this bottling by Coby Parker-Garcia. Bright flavors of hibiscus tea, pomegranate and raspberry ride a clean line of crushed thyme and peppercorn dust on the lively palate."
"Illogically, there are two second wines at this estate. This is the richer of the two (the other is Lions). It has intensity, spice, ripe apricot fruit and a smooth, dense texture. Its honey and botrytis notes are just right while the thread of acidity keeps it all in place. Drink from 2019."
"Wood aged and serious, this is a finely balanced wine. Its spice and toast notes are beginning to come together with its young, exuberant fruit and acidity. Black currant flavors dominate, giving it a crisp, juicy edge. Drink this impressive wine from 2021."
"This serious, ageworthy wine is the top in the series of three wines from the Moini estate. It's powerful and perfumed, with rich dark chocolate and superripe black plum and berry flavors. The tannins are still firm, showing its considerable potential. Wait until at least 2021 before drinking."
"Though this bottling still needs a year or so of patience to truly shine, it's a great example of cool-climate low-alcohol Syrah. Dark in the glass, it shows tar and lavender, but the core is like a black and blue pepper-crusted steak, with charred beef, raw beef and strong spice converging. The palate is all about raw meat, fresh-ground black peppercorn and squeaky tannins."
"This is the second wine of Moucho estate, a power in its own right. It is beautifully perfumed with violets and spice while its tannins and dark chocolate flavors are well integrated with the generous black fruits and acidity. The wine, even at four-years-old, is still young and will need much further aging. Drink from 2020."
"This beauty of a sweet wine has a perfume like jasmine and honeysuckle blossoms and flavors like Anjou pears and lychees. It's very ripe, succulent and almost thick on the palate, but far from simply syrupy. The exotic flavors expand with each sip, and linger a long time on the finish."
"Roasted coffee, charred lamb, dried plums, purple flowers and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard at the southern edge of the appellation, where it picks up a tad more coastal influence. After a soft entry to the palate with rustic cocoa and more coffee flavors, an exotic plum flavor takes over, proving a great balance between ripe and sour."
"Named after Roman emperor Probus, who allowed the replanting of vines in France, this finely mature wine is smooth, with a dry core. That structure supports secondary flavors and spice, which add to its juicy acidity and overall richness. Drink now."
"This is an earthy herbal wine that's also soft and supple on the palate. Dill, cedar and sage play against a tart core of cranberry and cassis, finding their way to a lingering layer of spicy clove. The power and weight of the fruit wears well against the ultimate grace of the wine."
"This is a head-turning Pinot Noir due to its darkness and depth. An intense crushed slate and loamy soil minerality dominates the nose, like serving pepper-dusted blackberry pie in a dark cave. A low-simmering acidity powers the almost Syrah-like sip, where boysenberry and elderberry meet with a roasted meat quality."
"There's a warm and welcoming note of baked goods and toasty brioche on the nose of this bottling, along with hints of vanilla and black cherry. The flavors are also very accessible and delicious, with black-cherry syrup, maple, brown sugar and more vanilla spice that carries deep into the finish. The tannins are firm enough to hold up the richness."
"The third generation of the Laplace family has produced a black-colored, juicy and richly balanced wine. Its black plum and damson fruit is enclosed in young, firm tannins that will gradually soften. It's a dark, dense wine that will be ready to drink by 2020."
"The natural late harvest richness of Petit Manseng makes this wine so rich and sweet. Its mango and honey sweetness is balanced by the intense acidity that also comes from this grape. It's beautiful, ripe and delicious now but will be better from late 2018."
"Intense aromas of menthol, pressed rose, dark spice, new leather and wild berry take shape on this fragrant full-bodied red. Concentrated and structured, the dense palate delivers Marasca cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and a hint of exotic spice framed in firm refined tannins."
"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The bright, elegantly structured palate delivers tart cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside vibrant acidity and tightly wound noble tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to develop. Drink 20232033."
"Old vines, many up to 80-years-old, supply the grapes that were fermented in traditional granite lagars for a ripe jammy character in this powerful wine. It has solid tannins and great acidity, both of which will allow the wine to age. Drink this impressive wine from 2020."
"This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate."
"Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar. Well structured, it unfurls depths of black cherry, currant and vanilla as it develops in the glass, finishing a full bodied as it started."
"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience."
"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard. Caramel sparks a richness against which herbal, woody tannins speak. The body expansive and full, and the finish awash in spicy clove."
"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors."
"This blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen is a satisfying melting pot of complex flavors. Its tannins are solid, although now complementing the rich berry fruits. It is an impressive wine that could still age further before complete maturity. Drink from 2019."
"Alluring aromas of beeswax, white spring flower and acacia float from the glass. On the vibrant palate, crisp acidity offsets yellow apple, Anjou pear and nectarine while the slightest hint of paraffin graces the dry finish."
"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers. There's a rich blueberry flavor at the core of the palate, where cocoa shavings, tense tannins and a lilac florals combine for a multi-layered wine."
"Alluring aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and an earthy note of tilled soil come together in the glass. The elegant, structured palate delivers red currant, Marasca cherry and star anise alongside bright acidity and refined tannins. It's well balanced and delicious. Drink through 2022."
"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea."
"What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine. It has plenty of tannins to support the intense blackberry and blueberry flavors, while enticing cinnamon, cumin and leather come up in the aroma and last through the lingering finish."
"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tanninsits dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019."
"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb."
"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region. It is intensely rich and solida classic blend for the region with a dominance of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, aged in wood and with plenty more aging ability. This black-fruit-flavored wine will be best from 2020."
"Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom."
"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice."
"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured."
"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019."
"Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity."
"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish."
"Extremely lively peppercorn aromas meet with black plum, blackberry, dried violets and lavender on the nose of this bottling by vineyard manager Ruben Solorzano. The palate is spicy with cracked pepper, rosemary oil and pine needles, which mix with the blackberry and elderberry fruits. Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish."
"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020."
"After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake."
"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crme de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity."
"From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity. Black licorice and spiced plum are given additional richness by a jolt of dark chocolate."
"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities."
"This blends Pinot Noir and Chardonnay into a sparkling experience that's dry and floral, with yeasty, toasty overtones that give it a deep sense of richness. Along with developed flavors of plum, cherry and apple, it lingers in nutmeg."
"Made from 80% Pinot Noir and 20% Chardonnay, this dances in cherry and orange brightness within a construct of white peach. The pretty-in-pink color gives way to buzzing acidity and freshness before a medium-strength creaminess flows through on the finish."
"Crisp peach and red-fruit flavors combine with vibrant acidity and energizing, fine bubbles to create a balanced and rich sparkling wine. A spicy, crisp fruit character lingers long on the finish."
"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Mourvdre, this is a thick, extracted exploration of strawberry and leather. Bright and brawny, it has supportive freshness and acidity beneath the power of its meaty ripe fruit."
"Candied red cherry, mulberry, lilac, kola nut and dark sandalwood show on the lush nose of this bottling. The palate is wound tightly around a tense structure and bright but not overpowering acidity, revealing flavors of allspice, dark red fruit and hints of juniper."
"Beet and plum juice aromas meet with hearty clove and juniper spice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard located 16 miles from the Pacific Ocean. It's a dark and deep expression on the sip, with blackberry, wet earth and pine-forest flavors, proving quite muscular and manly, with a menthol lift on the finish."
"Black pepper, espresso, dark berries and woody herbs show on the nose of this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Sangiovese, 13% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot and 6% Freisa from the Los Alamos and Valley View Vineyards. Stewed blackberries and more pepper show on the densely structured, acid-laced palate, which also offers coffee and dark chocolate flavors."
"Ripe blackberry and spice aromas are a touch meaty and earthy but mostly straightforward. A grabby, fleshy palate is obtuse but still balanced, while this tastes of berry and cassis, which are textbook flavors for Cabernet Sauvignon. A dry, woody finish with a chocolate note renders this better than most for $20."
"This wine is spot on with the modern Aussie movement towards light-bodied, moderate-alcohol wines, with little to no oak influence. From the cool climes of Western Victoria, this is downright delicious and a total bargain. Bright, ripe red cherry, chocolate, cola and violet notes lead into a plush yet zingy palate of juicy red fruits, silky soft tannins and a long tangy finish."
"In 1997, restoration architect Jos Perdigo used his skills to turn a 17-acre bench of unmerciful land above the Do river near Viseu into a garden of organic native vines. The 2006 now reflects maturity. It is packed with secondary flavors, ripe acidity, and toast and mushrooms from a blend dominated by Touriga Nacional. It is, luckily, very ready to drink."
"With a sniff of noble reduction, this is a well-made robust wine, indicative of its historic estate and small-production values. A juicy core of broad plum, dark cherry and pomegranate wrap seamlessly around a fresh streak of minerality and rich texture."
"Picked from selection of grapes from the estate's best parcels, this is a perfumed, dense and rich blend of Syrah, Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon. Its concentrated black fruits and rich tannins are impressive. It has style, too, as well as great ripe fruits and power. Drink this fine wine from 2019."
"This is an invitingly floral, textural and rich white wine that's full bodied and lush on the palate. Tropical pineapple, guava and mango are highlighted in deeper, darker tones of honey and caramel, with a foundation of present, integrated oak."
"With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking."
"Juicy black cherry and grippy oak are the stars of the show in this delicious red wine, softened by the addition of 16% Malbec. Elongated tannins support the leathery texture as highlights of cedar and sage play on."
"Made to benefit the exploratory organization, this high-toned stunner exudes flavors of Gravenstein apple followed by a slight richness of marzipan. Moderate acidity and weight makes it a fine companion for the table, finishing with a sense of welcome fullness."
"Very gamy and umami-rich aromas of bacon fat and animal hide meet with maple, boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and teriyaki on the nose of this bottling. The savory and somewhat smoky touches thrive on the palate too, where roasted pork and charred plums combine with coffee bean and warm-toast flavors."
"This classy wine is rich, with its firm structure still intact. It has bold tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and bright acidity. Its concentration, together with its dry, tannic core, confirms that it will age further. Drink from 2020."
"Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard. Strawberry, smoked pork and a touch of lavender show on the sip, which rides a strong acidity that arises in the midpalate and persists deep into the finish."
"Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The roasted quality carries through the sip, with more coffee and char tones alongside dried plums, crushed gravel and dusty tannins."
"The wine is dry, concentrated, very much in the house style of this legendary brand. It has acidity as well as the rich dried fruits, with the tannins a force in the background. It is a style of LBV that could age well, with its structure and acidity. Drink now, certainly, but it will be an even better wine from 2020 or 2022."
"Scott Sampler is employing some avant-garde techniques in his winemaking, including extra long macerations, but this blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Mourvdre and 25% Syrah is relatively straightforward. Aromas of stewed blackberry and red currant meet with licorice spice and a leathery richness on the nose. The palate shows black raspberry, vanilla dust, gingerbread and minty tarragon, laid upon a still-tight texture with lively acidity."
"From a well-farmed site, this wine is invitingly floral in apple-blossom notes, followed by fully developed flavors of peach and meringue. Earthy and complete, it offers concentration and balance."
"A black color and baked ripe-fruit aromas are the greeting on this second wine to Clos Apalta. While this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenre, Merlot and Petit Verdot feels soft along the edges, it's propped up by tartaric acidity. Blackened flavors of saturated blackberry and cassis maintain lush ripeness across the finish. Drink through 2020."
"Made with 65% Sangiovese and 35% Foglia Tonda, this fragrant full-bodied red offers aromas of new leather, purple flower, espresso, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The round polished palate boasts structure and elegance, delivering ripe black cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and licorice framed in velvety enveloping tannins. Drink through 2023."
"This inky, red-violet colored wine offers aromas of black plum and lavender. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, vanilla, espresso and violet sit among silky tannins that offer a pleasing textural experience to the entire palate. The finish is notable for a short burst of orange zest."
"This food-friendly wine is most remarkable for its structure and gracefulness on the palate. Herbal on the entry, it offers grip and elegance within sturdy elongated tannins, a note of brushy cedar and sage and integrated French oak."
"Fresh and lean as a sea breeze and tautly wrought in tense acidity, this memorable wine is bright and crisp. The palate shows earthy flavors met by subtle notes of black cherry and strawberry."
"This field blend of old white-grape vinesa rarity in the Dourois rich in the bottle from a mlange of stainless steel, wood fermentation and barrel aging. It is smooth with concentration from the toast flavors and floral complexity. Its ripe character and generous texture make it a wine to drink now."
"This balanced wine shows fine potential. Its structure dominates at the moment, with solid tannins, but the rich black fruit is all there. Let it develop over the next several years and drink from 2021."
"Beginning to mature, this rich wine with its beautiful honey and spice flavors is, as always with Petit Manseng, finely balanced with acidity. The texture is smooth and opulent, its mango fruit cut with lemon-like tang. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is very young, with its bright purple color, spice and wood aromas and firm texture. Although the wood is still integrating, its ripe blackberry fruit and rich texture show it has great potential and needs to age. Drink from 2020."
"Richly structured, this wine is dense and solid. It has swathes of ripe fruit, bold tannins and an impressive firm character. Its future is assured with its dense texture, black fruit and acidity all coming into place. Drink from 2021."
"This Merlot-dominated wine brings out both the juicy fruit typical of the vintage and a tight, smoky character that lends perfume. Still young, it's firmly structured and will age well. Drink from 2020."
"On the bank opposite the Sauternes region, Cadillac, with its fortified castle, is home to some richly liquorous wines. This 2010 is honeyed and opulent, with a smooth texture and just a bite of botrytis. Drink this peach- and bitter orange-flavored wine now."
"This seductive wine has aromas of mint and cassis leading to deliciously ripe and complex fruit flavors within a creamy texture. While braced by fine-grained tannins, the wine remains almost silky on the palate, bringing cherry, blueberry and mocha flavors that linger on the finish."
"Made and grown by one of Barossa's most highly respected wine families, the Kalleskes, this Shiraz is a complex specimen of dried cherries, herbs and beef marinade, with soft tannins and a long, savory finish. It's elegant and silky without having to flex its muscles."
"Extremely tight, clean and minerally aromas of chalk, citrus pith and lemongrass make for a very crisp and fresh nose on this white wine bottling of the typically red Grenache grape. The palate is just as zesty, with apple skin, green papaya and underripe mango flavors, showing flashes of tropicality while remaining light and tight."
"Plum, dark berry and baking-spice aromas slowly emerge on this full-bodied red. The taut spicy palate offers sour cherry, dried blackberry, ground clove and licorice set against a backbone of assertive but fine-grained tannins. It's still young and primary. Drink after 2025."
"Toasty, charred aromas point at pencil lead and graphite in addition to inky black fruits. This old-vines Cabernet is voluminous but tight on the palate, with sandpaper tannins. Saturated, blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with mocha and coffee notes along with abrasive residual tannins. Drink through 2028."
"Cherry liqueur, candied rose petals, rhubarb, sweet truffle and wet earth converge for a very sultry and dynamic nose on this bottling, showing that quite a bit of complexity can come from one clone. Well-integrated flavors of dark red fruit, vanilla and nutmeg show on the sip, which is woven together by persistent acidity."
"The tang of orange rinds and fresh lemon cake meet with hints of toasted coconut and white flowers on the nose of this solid bottling by Bill Foley's eponymous winery. The texture is crisp but grippy and tense on the sip, with seared orange slices and oak smoke flavors."
"Very light in the glass, this single vineyard expression shows, fresh pomegranate and rose petals on the expressive nose. It's tight and bright in the glass, with light raspberry, cranberry, fennel and chaparral spice."
"Richly layered with fruit, this full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has wonderful concentration, a good sense of depth and a creamy texture that has mild and supportive tannins. The mouthfeel is very supple and the dark berry and black-cherry flavors are ripe and delicious."
"There's a distinctive old-school quality that comes from these century-old vines, which make a slightly lighter wine with intriguing, almost pre-aged aromas of dried cherry, balsamic raspberry and salt-and-pepper spice. The palate is driven by a crushed rock texture and a bright acidity that drives deep into the finish, with flavors of aged cola and dried red fruit. It's even greater with a slight chill."
"Toast, moist underbrush, grilled herb and balsamic aromas lead the nose. On the full-bodied austere palate, fine-grained tannins support tart cherry, cranberry, vanilla and star anise. Give this several more years to unwind and develop. Drink 20132033."
"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows tons of underripe cranberry, dried rose petals, marjoram, white pepper and tangy olives on the nose. The light-bodied palate shows similar qualities, with fully extracted flavors of tart red fruits, purple flowers and white tea."
"This is classic Petit Verdot in Portugal: dark red, structured and firmly tannic with great fruits. The grape, normally found in Bordeaux, seems to be very much at home in this schist soil and hot climate of the Douro. Its tannins are there, but the blackberry fruit and acidity are just as important. Drink this from 2018."
"Plump aromas of white peach, lemon syrup, butterscotch and prominent oak show on the nose of this bottling, one of the richer ones in the current Talley lineup. The oak smoke flavors mix with vanilla and a finish of caramel on the palate, but the winery's reliably bright acidity hold the larger elements in check."
Touriga Nacional is the principal component of this rich blend from the lower Douro vineyards of Valle da Fonte. It is a concentrated wine with black plum and spice flavors. They are underlined by the dark tannins and black chocolate. This makes for a wine that needs further aging. Drink from at least 2019.
"Neutral French oak played a part in this wine's fermentation, giving it weight and substance without distraction. Exotic on the nose, it's fleshy and high toned in guava and lemon zest, with a memorable length of mineral-like stone that gives it texture and complexity."
"A heartier and meatier take on Pinot Noir, this bottling shows black plums, hoisin, hickory smoke and pepper on the nose. The palate is also rich with plum sauce and strong fennel flavors, showing oak smoke as well. Quite tasty overall for those seeking some heft."
"Fermented in open granite lagars, this rich wine with its violet aromas is generous and has considerable power. It comes from a great vintage and shows that in its dark fruits and still-firm tannins. This is a serious wine, showing the grapes from the hard soils of the Do at their best. Drink from 2019."
"With smoky aromas and structured tannins, this is still young and firm. Under those tannins, the black currant fruit is developing to give a ripe wine with fine acidity and structure. Drink from 2020."
"With its spice and mint aromas, this wine shows its 30% new wood aging strongly. On the palate, the mint flavors balance with rich black fruit and a strong, firmly tannic backbone. Rich and full of potential, it will be ready to drink from 2020."
"This producer, firmly established in Vinho Verde and the Douro, also has vineyards at Quinta da Aguieira in the central coastal region of Bairrada. A blend of local white grapes along with some Chardonnay, this wine is ripe, with a touch of saltiness and minerality, plus plenty of concentration from old vines. With its rich texture and crisp aftertaste, this is ready to drink."
"There's a deep sense of crushed rock minerality in this bottling, which is rare for a variety typified by rose petals and red fruit. It's darker on the fruit front, with black raspberry and elderberry on the nose along with sagebrush, turned loam and dust. The palate adds boysenberry, eucalyptus, fennel and light but impactful tannins to the mix, making for a very complex wine."
"Buoyant aromas of boysenberry juice, white pepper and a touch of rosemary show on the nose of this blend of 34% Merlot, 33% Tempranillo and 33% Syrah, whose name means my steps and is an homage to the parents of winemaker Edgar Torres. Sticky tannins frame a medium-weight body full of sage, bay leaf and peppercorn flavors, which decorate the elderberry fruit. This is still a very young wine."
"Crisp and clean aromas of chalk and lime pith meet with riper touches of honeydew and Anjou pear on the nose of this blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, which hints at a biting acidity on the sip. The freshness extends to the palate, where riper guava tones are deftly cut by citrus peels and finished with a minty lift. The structure is tense and ideal, while the acidity is available but not overwhelming."
"Intricate baking spice aromas and buttery apple-tart flavors meet a delicate yet expansive mouthfeel in this light-bodied, irresistible and off-dry wine. The spicy elements weave in and out of the silky texture and continue to echo on the finish."
"Aromas of cherries baked in a flaky vanilla crust meet with cola, fresh boysenberry and damp herbs on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. Bright raspberry shows on the lighter-framed and very energetic palate, with flavors of fennel frond, dried marjoram and a gravel-laced minerality."
"The golden richness of Petit Manseng is very evident in this dry wine. There are the hallmark hints of honey and hugely ripe citrus and grapefruit flavors. They give both power and intensely crisp fruitiness, making this just now ready to drink."
"This wine envelopes the senses and coats the mouth with its honey and ripe yellow fruit flavors. It's rich and unctuous yet has the acidity and poise typical of the vineyards in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains. Young now, it will age. Drink from 2019."
"Balanced and fruity, this ripe, sweet wine delivers both botrytis and generous fruit. It has fine acidity to cut through the richness, giving intense sweetness and a dry core. Drink from 2021."
"This wine's black currant aromas shine. It's still young and structured, its firm tannins at the fore. But those black currant flavors are crisp and fruity, highlighting its fine balance, as all the elements fall into place. Drink from 2020."
"Dusty tannins and ripe fruit set the scene for this wine, which is rich in both structure and black fruit. With its concentration, it is sure to develop well, likely to mature easily over several years. Drink from 2020."
"The aromas pop, with notes of brown sugar, dried pear and honey. The palate is incredibly rich and intense but with high-wire acidity that keeps all of the flavors in vivid focus. The sense of balance is exquisite."
"Beautifully bright aromas of pomegranate, cherry, rose petals, hibiscus and cola draw the nose deeply into this bottling by Sonja Magdevski, who's focusing almost exclusively on Grenache these days. The tannins are firmer than expected for a lighter style, carrying impressive flavors of violet, cola and rose. It's delicate but grippy."
"Deep and lavish aromas of baked black currant, caramel, condensed violets and fudge get a licorice lift on the nose of this blend of 41% Syrah, 41% Grenache and 18% Mourvdre. It's fairly nimble on the palate given the bombastic nose, with balanced flavors of blackberry, vanilla and orange zest proving quite the crowd-pleaser."

"This is an unusual limited-production wine from Perdigo's highest hottest vineyard. It is not often to find a 100% Alfrocheiro despite being native to the Do region.

It has power and concentration and is likely to remain very firm into the future. Drink now or take a risk and cellar."

"The Jura's Savagnin grape gives fruity wines with a strong yeasty, salty character. That's very evident in this fine example. With its rich apple fruit and hints of almonds, it's full, spicy, tangy and aromatic. Drink now, although it will age at least until 2020."
"This is one of the most Italian-tasting wines made in California, because of its complex blend of spicy earthy characters and moderate fruit flavors, grippy tannins and good acidity. It's nicely dry, well balanced, has interesting oaky accents on top of mildly fruity and also savory notes. Unusual because it's not vintage dated, but don't let that dissuade."

"That vintage is not a typo. This 10-year-old wine is as lively as ever.

It will certainly age further and this fine wine will be best drunk from 2019."
"The Pags family, which has a group of estates in the Mdoc, has produced a rich, concentrated wine at this chteau. While packed with black currant fruit from the 60% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it also has a firm layer of tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2021."

Notes of smoke, lemon, melon, vanilla oak and a slight vegetal character lead into a nicely textured palate and a long, smokey finish. The acidity is rather searing at the moment, and the oak a bit apparent, but give this a little time and all will settle into place. Drink now2025."
"Earthy, gamy aromas are intense and suggest meaty berry fruits and animal hide. In the mouth, this mystery red blend feels jammy but soft at its core.

"Slightly lighter on its feet than its sibling, L-Block, the Lieu-Dit shows more meat and black olive characters combined with ripe cherry, chocolate, cola, and oak spice. The palate is tangy and herbal while the powerful tannins are fine grained and the acidity well balanced. This should age rather nicely. Drink 20192037."

"The slow-growing trend of white Pinot Noir finally landed on the Central Coast and Coby Parker-Garcia gives it a compelling argument in this bottling.

The palate is tightly wound with fresh flavors of honeysuckle and more orange blossom."
"This is a bright, fully realized wine from the distinctive appellation: soft with an integrated approach to its use of oak. Wild strawberry, cranberry and a threading of dried herb combine effortlessly into a pleasurable whole."

Drink from 2018."

This wine is a golden color that is showing some browning despite its youth. The aromas offer notes of marmalade and diesel. The flavors are concentrated and sugary sweet. It delivers plenty of enjoyment but seems advanced for its age. Enjoy it sooner than later.
"This poised late-harvest blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc tastes lightly honeyed, with an edge of dry botrytis. Perhaps more prominent are the dried apricot and spice notes, along with balanced acidity. Intense and in need of more aging, it will be best from late 2018."

"Made from two vineyards in the appellation, this shows black cherry, cedar and tobacco, with a graphite element not far behind. Sticky tannins provide grip and weight, as full-bodied richly ripe blue fruit and plum form a continuum between hits of clove."
"This wine comes from the state's oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines, planted in 1957. Light in color, the aromas draw you into the glass with notes of earth, cassis, dried herb and cherry.

"This Port, still young to taste, is a dry style of LBV giving structure as much as fruit at this stage. It does have floral black fruits from the Touriga Nacional in the blend.

"Fresh, vibrant and tangy, this is a great example of a dry light-bodied but very appetizing wine. Canteloupe and peach aromas lead to citrus and raspberry flavors that are lean but tasty. It's one of the best California Sangiovese ross."
"This is a very good example of an unoaked Chardonnay. It has lots of zingy fresh-fruit aromas, lively citrus and green-apple flavors and good supportive acidity to keep the mouthfeel tangy. Winemaker Karl Wente made this one to please his no-frills dad, Eric Wente."
"Pale gold in color, this wine leads with notes of fresh apples, blossoms and honeycomb. The palate is prickly and refreshing, with a good lick of acidity and some texture and weight to prop it up. Drink now."

"Herbal in cedar, this medium-bodied wine is simply layered, with a thickness of tannin and oak, its mouthfeel substantial yet smooth. Black fruit speaks loudesta mix of black cherry, blueberry and blackberry jam."
"As a partner to the red wine from this estate, with its Bordeaux blend, this wine brings together the Bordeaux white grapes of Sauvignon Blanc and Smillon.

Drink this tropical, fruity and pear-flavored wine from 2018."
"Tart ripe pineapple is given a caramel flip of richness and concentration in this lush integrated wine, that is heady in oak and made in a voluptuous style."

Dusty blackberry and black currant ride along a carpet of leather and meat."
"Enticing scents of violet, rose and woodland berry escape the glass. Full bodied and polished, the palate delivers black cherry, cranberry, licorice and crushed herb while austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide an age-worthy framework.

"Herbal aromas of green tobacco, black fruits and coffee grounds require some understanding of Carmenre to fully appreciate. A chunky, saturated palate is thick but balanced by tartaric acidity. Herbal, minty blackberry flavors are woody and show a hint of graphite, while coffee, carob and burnt toast flavors blend with green notes on the finish. Drink through 2020."

"This wine offers attractive layers of green apple built around a lush palate of pear and tropical pineapple. Its richness is met by complementary structure, balance and a subdued construct of oak that supports without distraction."

"Coming from Boushey Vineyard, this is a seldom-seen variety in the state. This offering seems a bit reduced out of the gate, showing aromas of garden hose along with lemon. The medium-bodied citrus rind and lemon flavors bring plenty of appeal along with a big blast of acidity. If the reduction blows off, it moves up a notch or two as the palate flat-out impresses."
"On first take, this hefty Carmenre smells almost entirely of massive oak and related vanilla and maple, although airing calms things down.

"Aromas of exotic spice, forest floor and a balsamic note emerge in the glass while the full-bodied palate doles out ripe red cherry, cranberry, licorice and clove.

"Aromatic in style, this veers on the side of perfume on the nose. Nevertheless, it's very likable. Red apple skins and florals lead on the palate that's a little soapy, but is well balanced and stylish. More red apple lingers on the finish. Drink now2020."
"With aromas of cherry cough syrup and expensive oak, this is a big, rich, flashy Shiraz. Fine-grained tannins, balanced acidity and plenty of plush fruit mark the palate, but the oak is a little too much in the fore."
"Crisp and tangy, this light-bodied wine has a (pardon the pun) piny green-apple aroma, vivid apple and lime flavors and lively acidity. It will be especially good as an apritif to whet the appetite."
"This passito-style blend of Muscat Ottonel and Vidal Blanc is layered with amber honey, marmalade, apricot in the fruit camp, and hazelnut, mushroom,toast and ginger for complexity. The palate is equally stimulating and leads to a gorgeous earthiness at the end. In feel this is silky smooth, with ample acidity to carry the plushness. The finish is long and harmonious."

"This opulent blend of all four Do grapes (Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Alfrocheiro and Jaen) is structured, full of tannins and sports a dry core. Its black fruits are in balance with this bold structure, giving a wine that is solid and concentrated, and still needing some aging. Drink from late 2018."

"This dark-tinted Carignan smells of licorice, lemony oak and loamy, candied cassis. In the mouth, this is rough and raw on the surface but jammy in the midpalate. A mix of ripe raisin, cassis and licorice flavors are herbal and peppery, while the tannins on the finish don't cease. At 15.5% abv, this is over the top and heady."
"This intense and spicy wine comes from a vineyard planted in 1925 on chalk soils. While red fruit is dominant, there are also some firm tannins to back up its juiciness. It's likely to improve over the next few months and will be ready to drink in mid-2018."

"In a sea of dense, dark-fruited Barossa Shiraz, it can be a refreshing change to find something with a little more elegance and high fruit tones, even if the aromas venture a slightly into soap territory. Ripe strawberry mingles with baking spices, Dr. Pepper and a savory note. The tannins are tongue-gripping but balanced by a nice acidity and a herbal character on the finish. Drink now2025."
"As the entry-level Chardonnay from one of Margaret River's most highly lauded producers, this has a creamy opulence to it, with notes of buttercups, lemon drops and toasty oak. The palate is of medium weight, with a viscous texture and a good lick of acidity to keep things fresh, but the oak is a little flashy, particularly on the finish."
"Tiers of aromas and flavors in this expressive wine reveal themselves like a Matryoshka doll. Wafts of dried apricot and chamomile open into tangerine peel and marmalade, then finally marzipan and ginger come forth on the nose. Concentrated flavors mimic the aromas and introduce fresh vanilla bean and hay. Racy acidity thrills, while two years in neutral French oak keeps the wine round and full-bodied.

"Jammy, candied berry and prune aromas are reduced. That theme continues onto the palate, which feels compacted. Flavors of black grapes, prune, blueberry and black pepper finish with a meaty note of beef jerky, raw tannins and a shortage of body. Very good but with flaws."

"El Capricho is one of Uruguay's more consistent wineries in terms of putting out wines of character and quality.

A pulling drawing palate is a bit tannic, while this tastes of toasty oak, plum and tomato. Drink through 2020."
This exuberant and friendly wine has delicious and very pure straightforward fruit flavors of black cherry and blackberry and a smooth non-tannic texture that make it easy to sip despite being full bodied.

"Apricot and peach aromas lead the way in this still-tight, mineral wine. Its richness is drawn up at this stage, showing crisp acidity as well as honey and pineapple flavors. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2019."
"Barrel aromas are up front, with notes of vanilla, dill and wood spice in front of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are plump and plush, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. There are lots of good things going on here but the wood gets in the waya shame as the fruit is impressive."
"This wine's jammy black fruit aromas lead to a soft, full and ripe palate. Black plum flavors, rich tannins and layers of toast from wood aging signal both youth and solid, firm character. Drink from 2021."

"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, aromas of herb, red fruit, flower and spice are at the fore. The palate is full with red and black-fruit flavors with a lightly tacky feel."

"A bit more austere than some of Kilikanoon's other cuves, Mort's Block is in it for the long haul. Still a baby, it currently shows lemon-lime characters, with kerosene and Barbie doll plastic. The palate is linear and supercitrusy. Drink 20182025."

"Cabernet Sauvignon dominates in this 66% to 35% blend, with both varieties grown on the producer's Lookout Mountain estate. Full bodied, it features stewed plum, dark chocolate and mocha, with a base of cedar and clove. Extended tannins make it fleshy and full."

"Aromas of wild rose, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of grilled Porcini mushroom slowly emerge. The taut, austere palate shows cranberry, raw sour cherry, star anise and clove framed in firm acidity and tightly wound, close-grained tannins that clench the finish. This needs time to unfurl and fully develop. Drink after 2023."
"Aromas of dark culinary spice, iris, berry and a whiff of oak lead the nose. The linear, tightly wound palate shows raw cranberry, clove and star anise framed in racy acidity. Taut close-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Give this a few more years to unwind then drink."

"This opens with aromas reminiscent of stewed plum, dark culinary spice, espresso and a balsamic note. The assertive palate is still tightly wound, offering dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and tobacco set against taut, close-grained tannins. Drink 20202028."

"Grainy, resiny oak aromas share space on the nose with herbal black fruit and green scents. This is racy and fresh for Carmenre, with full-force tannins. Herbal, roasted black-fruit and chocolate flavors are long and oaky on the finish, with a mocha note. Drink through 2020."
"The nose of this wine is bursting with raspberry, cranberry jam, violets and geranium. These notes carry to the palate, effortlessly melding together with a faint hint of tar. Soft cedar and nutmeg from 18 months in French oak offer compexity and a full structure. A smooth texture and well-integrated tannins make for a long and complex finish."

"From one of the region's leading producers and biodynamic rockstars, this wine stands out from the crowd. It offers apple tart, lemon rind and wild mint, with some floral soap notes. The acidity is present but not overpowering, balanced by some textural weight and an attractive citrus and spice finish."
"An opaque color is appropriate for this fully extracted Tannat. Aromas of blackberry, sandalwood and exotic spices are a strong point, while the palate is primed with grating acidity. Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity."
"A generous blend of Alicante Bouschet, Touriga Nacional, Aragonez and Syrah, this is firm with tannins and packed with ripe blackberry fruits. Six months in wood added a toasty character enhancing the complexity and depth of the wine. Drink from 2019."
"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved."
"A blend of organically cultivated Corvina, Rondinella and Corvinone, this has enticing aromas of red berry and fragrant blue flower. The juicy palate offers red cherry, red currant and a hint of green pepper alongside smooth tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy soon."
"This wine shows a pleasing nose of black currant cordial, violets, hot cocoa powder and some smokey oak aromas. The palate is relatively light in feel for the powerful three (Grenache, Shiraz, Mourvdre), yet with a juicy fruit core, grainy texture and savory tannins, this is a solid GSM."

"This is the second wine of Vieille Cure, one of the leading Fronsac estates. It is aging well, moving from fruit to mature, secondary flavors, softening in the process. Wood aging has balanced the blackberry fruit with spice and made it ready to drink."
"Wonderful dark and ripe fruit flavors fill out this wine beautifully, shaped by a velvety, softly tannic texture and mild acidity. Hints of chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon develop on the palate. From a long-time standard bearer for value, this wine is a no-lose proposition."

"Briary, minty berry aromas are highly herbal and straight from the traditional Chilean recipe. This is saturated and full-bodied, with scratchy tannins that do nothing to tame the mouthfeel. Heavily blackened and toasted berry flavors are spicy like pepper, while a chocolaty, dry finish is made firm by arid tannins. Drink through 2025."
"This Tannat (with 15% Viognier) is full and oaky up front, with vanilla notes accenting berry aromas. Astringent tannins make for a rubbery palate. Lightly stewed flavors of plum and mixed spices finish long, with a note of herbal tomato."
"Aromas of prune, raisin and baking spice lead the nose. The youthfully austere, primary palate shows raisin and ground pepper alongside bracing tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins another couple of years then drink to capture the remaining fruit."
"Strong spicy, meaty aromas and equally assertive oak and char flavors threaten to overwhelm the fruity aspects of this dry wine, but it has enough concentrated blackberry and blueberry stuffing to match the firm tannins. Best after 2020."
Aromas suggesting Spanish broom and toasted nut lead the way while the ripe palate shows juicy yellow peach and chamomile. A note of bitter almond wraps up the finish.

You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol."
"There are some curious, almost Syrah-like elements to this bottling from a rural region between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, but it's an interesting wine. Aromas of concentrated blueberry and blackberry meet with tar, peppercorn and black licorice on the nose. Then the palate shows dark fruit with fennel, oregano, marjoram, black-olive and beef-crust flavors."
"Quite yellow in the glass, this solid bottling of a tough-to-master grape shows rich aromas of dried lemon peel, beeswax, smoke, nut oil and sandstone on the nose. The viscous palate offers dried pears, seared lemons and a hint of salinityelements that will continue to converge and gain nuance with cellar time."
"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors."

"Jammy aromas of raisin and baking spices are a touch herbal. This kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, Garnacha, Petit Verdot and Tempranillo feels rugged and grating. Classic Chilean flavors of reedy plum, berry and tomato end with a minty green note and a touch of fennel."
"The aromas are light, with notes of fresh tobacco, tangerine peel, moist earth, cedar and cherry. The wood tannins come off as a little aggressive at present but there's plenty of lovely fruit there as well."
"Heat and a touch of volatility are factors on an herbal, oaky nose that sees black-fruit aromas turn to road tar. A saturated, flush palate is braced by rock-hard tannins. Herbal plum and oak spice flavors finish dry, peppery and hot. After a number of years in bottle, this is still closed and hard."

"This is a robust mouth-filling wine with good fruit flavors, nice accents of black pepper and grilled beef, and a nip of sweetness to take the edge off moderate tannins. It's made from two of the classic Foothills grape varieties: Zinfandel and Barbera."
"Port made from white grapes is a great cocktail base (think white Port and Tonic for a start) as well as a delicious drink in its own right. This wine, well poised between sweet and dry, is a rich golden color, with dried apricot and plenty of fresh citrus to give it a crisp texture. Drink now."

"Reduced and extracted, this is a hearty blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Viognier. A juicy backbone of high-toned cherry is met by pretty aromas of violet as broad-shouldered body weight and texture provide a meaty edge."
"The aromas seem surprisingly subdued for the variety and style, with notes of flower, herb and spice. It drinks sweet but doesn't quite have the acid to back it up."

Caramel oak meets thick tar and sticky tannin in this robust wine from the mountain appellation. Dark brooding fruit is seasoned in minty earth and forest floor.

"Built around 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also contains 17% Merlot and smaller percentages of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Given a good amount of time in barrel, it expresses char, bacon fat and a luxurious and thickly rich amount of black fruit. Concentrated, it should please a wide array of palates."

"Blackberry, prune and pencil eraser aromas are oaky and forced. A heavy, grabby palate with noticeable oak resin delivers chocolaty, oaky berry flavors that taste a bit artificial. In the grand scheme of things, this is more than fair for the price; but prior years were better."
"This is a seldom-seen variety in the state. The aromas are brooding, with high-toned notes of dried herb, barrel spice and potpourri along with red fruit. The fruit flavors are tart and plump, soft and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of purity. One wants a bit more aromatically but there's still much to enjoy."
"Of the two styles of wines made by this producer, this is the one that's softer and easy to drink when young.

"Gritty aromas of red-berry and roasted fruit are not overly ripe. This feels firm, with high-toned acidic energy and a raspy afterburn. Oaky plum and currant flavors finish dry and hot. Not much cushion or softness here; requires food."

"This wine harmoniously combines bright red cherry, leafy bramble, black pepper and cedar on the nose. These notes carry through to the palate and mix with tobacco and balsamic flavors. Well-integrated tannins lead to a long, evolving finish."
"A seemingly reduced nose smells of alfalfa and grass, even more so than fruit. Shrill acidity is loud for Uruguayan Tannat. Herbal grapey plum flavors are salty, while this is full of tension and acidity on the finish."

"With 15 months of wood aging enhancing the natural richness of old vines, this impressive wine is both spicy and packed with fruit. It is young, still with its bright baby fruit and with acidity that needs to soften. The wine, with its pepper toast flavors as well as its rich apple and citrus fruits, will be best from 2018."
"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling from a vineyard often known for subtlety packs in a ton of power and darkness, starting with hefty blackberry, tree bark and sarsaparilla on the nose. Tart black-plum-skin flavors kick off the big palate, which grabs attention but is a little clumsy at this stage of life. Patience may bring cohesion."

"This smells ripe and bright, with grapy and chocolate praline aromas which lead to a palate that is immersed in oak spices and nutmeg. This is a nicley balanced wine with smooth tannins and a long, spicy finish."
"The aromas bring notes of vanilla, cream and baking spice, with the oak playing a prominent part but still showing appeal. The palate brings sweet cinnamon flavors that linger on the finish."

"Produced from Aragonez this is a soft wine, full of red-currant flavors as well as a touch of vanilla and caramel. It is an easy, refreshingly spicy wine, ready to drink now."

"This wine has yummy, fresh fruit aromas and flavors and a supple texture. The cherry, raspberry and plum notes are easy to savor due to medium body, light tannins and rather soft acidity."

"Peach pit and citrus-rind aromas are solid, focused and dry. This brut ros feels sound and round, but foamy. Cantaloupe and peach flavors maintain the palate's yeasty notes while turning slightly bitter."
"Lush black plum, bramble and black pepper mingle with cedar and spicy oak notes in this wine. These extend to the palate, where licorice and dried herbs linger. This wine is deep and extracted, so the full tannic structure does not seem out of place."

"Age has mellowed this potent Port-style wine a bit but hardly tamed it. The dark auburn edge to the otherwise black color hints at its maturity as do the pruny nutty roasted-cherry flavors. It's very full bodied and definitely sweet, but not cloying."

"Aromas of butterscotch, herb and barrel spice are followed by full-bodied cherry and vanilla flavors, with the tannins bringing some grit. Ultimately, the wood seems to get a bit in the way of the fruit."

Aromas of Nestea ice tea and slightly past-their-prime flowers are followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors that need more acid to stand them up. It doesn't all come together.
"Heavy aromas of chocolate, exotic herbs and ripe black fruits stop short of clubbing you over the head. The palate, however, is not that subtle; it's thick and chewy in an overripe way.

"The aromas lean pretty far into the green, with notes of savory herb along cherry with wood spice, which seems a bit prominent. The fruit flavors are plump but retain a sense of elegance. Ultimately the sense of greenness proves a bit too distracting."
"This bright, easy-drinking red offers aromas and flavors of wild cherry, crushed raspberry and freshly ground pepper. It's fresh and enjoyable, with soft tannins. Drink soon."

"This medium-bodied wine has fresh red cherry and strawberry aromas followed by light cherry and plum flavors, very mild tannins and a rather soft texture."
"Aromas of lemongrass and freshly-cut grass carry to a streamlined, lemon-driven palate. It is a touch too acidic to drink on it's own but would pair well with vegetable dishes."
"Neutral aromas include hints of sea foam and salty brine. This Brazilian brut feels standard and regular. Peachy flavors are mild and a touch grassy, while this feels waxy on the finish."
"Although drinking this wine while fishing would be just right, the name actually derives from the marine fossils in the soil. It's fruity, with a mineral texture and green, herbal character. At once rounded and cut with acidity, it's ready to drink."
"Barrel aged for 12 months, this 95% Merlot wine (with a dash of Cabernet Franc) is very dominated by its wood. That gives it a seriously toasty character that dominates the fruit. At five years old, it should be more balanced."
"Dense and dry, this is a tough, extracted wine. It has a hard edge followed by juicy acidity and will probably remain on the dry side."
"This ripe wine is fruity, with both citrus and tropical flavors. Light and bright, with a crisp, tangy texture, it's ready to drink."
"The spicy wood aroma that shows strongly on the nose of this wine is confirmed on the palate, as it seems to have spent too much time in barrels. The fruit has been neglected and is dry. It will open up with time, although the dryness will probably remain."
"Pinched aromas of herbal plum show a hint of ammonia before settling. This feels raw due to high tartaric acidity. Oaky, roasted plum and berry flavors are backed by notes of carob and wood resin on the finish."
"Mildly fruity and very smooth in texture, this wine is quietly agreeable. It is medium to full bodied, feels rich on the palate and tastes ripe and subtle like honeydew melon."
"This is a lightly structured wine with a soft juicy black-fruit character. It is smooth, rounded and with a crisp aftertaste from the acidity. It is ready to drink."
"The vineyard is named for a 16th century archbishop whose jurisdiction in the Age of Discovery covered all lands discovered and to be discovered. This wine is soft with pear and peach fruit and light acidity. It is balanced and warm, its creamy texture giving an attractive roundness and smoothness. The wine is ready to drink."
"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is meant to be a flinty, grassy and herbal experience, especially as the main variety was blended with 3% Riesling. Simple and dry, it offers peach, lemon zest and lychee fruitiness and medium weight."
"Roasted, smoky aromas push oak-based clove notes. This is a full-bodied, blocky PN that's tipping the scales in the direction of heavy. Roasted, medicinal berry and plum flavors follow the nose, while this ends with salty notes and a final blast of oaky clove."
"This is an easygoing wine with vanilla and cinnamon flavors, a soft texture and a touch of sweetness coating the fruit flavors contributed by Syrah, Merlot and other blenders."
"This blend of Altesse, Jacqure and Chardonnay is bitter at first. That edge gives way to a creamy mousse that fills the mouth with nut, dried plum and spice flavors.The aftertaste is dry."
"The wine is rounded and fat with an oily texture. Its ripe apple and rich pear flavors only allow a small place for the acidity and crisp texture. It comes across as full bodied, rich and easy to drink now."
"Waxy plum and a surprising characteristic of watermelon provide a subtle freshness to this otherwise hugely tannic, concentrated wine. Tar and yeast play a role as well."
"Red berry white pepper and saline aromas carry through to the simple light-bodied palate along with a hint of almond. It's fresh and easy drinking, with bright acidity. Enjoy soon."
"The wine is full of the warmth of the Alentejo sun. While it does have a crisp and juicy side, it is the richness and concentration that makes it attractive. Black fruits and toast from the oak aging are balanced and cut through with acidity. Drink now."
"An initial cranberry note is subdued by vanilla and clove aromas. Spice is dominant on the palate, interspersed with anise and leafiness. Full bodied and big on flavor, this would be a good steak accompaniment."
"Red cherry, strawberry and black-pepper aromas follow through to the simple rustic palate along with hints of cured meat and bitter almond. It's vivacious, with lively acidity."
"Candied yellow apples, sweet honeydew and very ripe Bosc pears show on the nose of this bottling. Tropical flavors of guava and tuberose dominate the sip, proving a tad thick and fruity."
"With a simple nose of citrus fruits, this wine has flavors of lemon, apple and freesia. It is a bit stiff at first, but opens on the palate, offering an apple-tinged finish."
"This Romanian Riesling has aromas of peach, lemon blossom and honeysuckle. In the mouth there are flavors of apricot and lemon zest. The finish is clean and a bit astringent."
"This is a spicy wood-laden wine. Considering it is three-years-old, it seems likely that the burnt-wood flavor will remain. That spoils what is otherwise a ripe and juicy wine with fine black fruits."
"Syrah and Trincadeira, both known to be spicy, fit comfortably together in this generous, soft and fruity wine. Juicy black fruits and acidity come together with the tangy texture to produce a wine with an attractive pepper bite as well as great fruitiness. Drink now."
"Aromas of grape skins and raspberry are mild. This ros of Tannat feels chunky, with mild acidity. Salty saucy berry flavors finish with a grabby, rubbery feel and very little to no residual flavor."
"Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz, Casteo and Syrahthe four grapes in this blend are gently wood aged. That has smoothed out the already gentle tannins, giving the wine a creamy ripe texture enhanced by red fruit flavors. Drink now."
"Ripe peach, honeysuckle and honeydew are pronounced in the aromas of this late harvest wine. Juicy in feel, there is something not unlike the syrup in a can of peaches. Without needed acidity, it feels flabby and ends in a short finish."
"Showing its age, but unfortunately not very well, this wine has lost any semblance of freshness, with notes of overripe lemons, stone fruit, pressed buttercups and buttered green beans. The palate is more attractive in its creamy texture, balanced by plenty of acidity. The finish once again descends into rather off-putting buttered green bean flavors."
"The blend of Bical and Arinto is typical of the sparkling wines from the Bairrada region. Together they give a crisp style of wine, bright with acidity and tangy with citrus and orange peel. The wine is ready to drink."
"Bold with tannins, this spicy wine is dense and dark. It's all structure and dryness at the moment. And, although the fruit is there, it looks as though the tannins will remain."
"This firm, structured wine is lean and austere. Spice and toast notes dominate, leaving little room for fruit. It's a tough wine to like."
"Bitter chocolate aromas and woody flavors are the hallmarks of this smoky, burnt toast-inflected wine. That bitter quality probably won't go away, leaving the fruit behind."
"This young wine is full of black currant fruit and balanced tannins. It has the richness of high alcohol, which brings out a touch of pepper. But juicy fruit dominates. Drink from 2018."
"An unusual find of an old vintage currently available, this is certainly a mature wine. In fact, it is beginning to dry outfocused on old tannins rather than on the wonderful secondary flavors of a well-aged Bordeaux. For lovers of older wines, this is a bargain curiosity."
"This soft and fruity wine may be young, but with its bright red fruits, it's ready to drink. Its juicy red berry flavors are filled with spice and a minty character from wood aging. It finishes with ripe fruitiness."
"It is fascinating how some wines from this vintage have gone from youth to old age without passing maturity. That's the case here: this wine is showing age, with tannins that have become dry, leaving the secondary flavors, let alone the fruit, behind."
"This wine is dry and smoky, with serious tannins. It is concentrated, with bitter chocolate flavors from the wood aging."
"This wine is light and fruity, poised between rich tropical and herbal-laced green fruits. It has a perfumed touch from the Sauvignon Gris in the blend and a crisp texture. Drink from early 2018."
"Dusty aromas come with notes of ham and tropical fruits. This is more blah than focused. Tropical fruits, grapefruit and pickle brine comprise the flavors prior to a salty, slightly green finish."
"The rarely used Atlantique appellation covers much the same region as Bordeaux, with less stringent rules. This 100% Sauvignon Blanc wine is fruity, easy, soft and full of citrus flavors. Drink now."
"Baked, earthy berry and herbal aromas turn murky and suggest animal as this breathes. A wiry, pulling palate with clipped acidity and hard tannins tastes of tart plum, tomato, herbs and grass. While the finish is shaken and stirred, it's not broken. This is Tannat and Syrah."
"This Romanian Chardonnay is golden straw in color with green reflections. It has aromas of green apple and Bartlett pear and flavors of lemon, apple and peach juice. The finish is crisp, but just a touch too acidic."
"Prune, grilled herb and a whiff of salted-game aromas carry over to the light-bodied palate along with dried black cherry and a hint of clove. It's ber-simple, with loose fleeting tannins."
"This is made from the most widely planted red grape in Vinho Verde, Vinho. It is soft and juicy with a ripe character and almond and caramel flavors. Drink now."
"This crisp blend of Arinto and Ferno Pires is light and fruity. Acidity and a lively mousse make for an attractive bright wine, with toast and almonds at the end. Drink now."
This is a lean wine with considerable structure and acidity but perhaps not enough fruit. There is a green edge to the fruit although the tannins are ripe enough. It is ready to drink now.
Prickly aromas are short on fruit. This is a streamlined SB with spritz on the palate. Lean citrus flavors are briny and slightly bitter on the finish.
"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is a citrus and apple-flavored medium-dry wine. With plenty of acidity, bright and packed with easy fruitiness, the wine is ready to drink."
"This is a smooth wine, soft with just a hint of tannins and with plenty of juicy acidity. Black-currant fruitiness dominates this crisp, clean and ready to drink wine."
"This is a simple, somewhat muted wine, with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Sanguine, it shows a touch of red currant, cassis and cedar in addition to a burly full-bodied concentration of ripeness."
"This lightly sweet and simple wine tastes straightforward, very fruity, soft in texture and light to medium in body."
This wine's strawberry jam aromas lead to a palate dominated by tannins. It's dry and missing fruit.
"This is a fat wine with light, juicy acidity. Honey and spice notes add interest to its broad melon and apple flavors."
This light to medium-bodied wine follows initially earthy and metallic aromas with decent plum flavors. The aroma clears up with time and the wine's soft texture and fruitiness peek through.
"Even for the rich 2015 vintage, this is an excessive wine. Made from superripe Merlot with high extraction, it adds dark chocolate flavors to its rich, juicy blackberry jelly fruit, feeling too big and over-the-top."
"Spicy and smoky, this wine is dark with tannins and dryness. Its dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors suggest tough extraction. The fruit does not stand a chance."
"Minty new wood aromas are the theme in this wood-laden wine. It has a burnt character from high extraction and wood aging, making it hard to discern the fruit, although there is a juicy character at the end."
"Dry, firm and tough, this wine lacks the fruit fruit to come through the structure. It's a wine for those who like plenty of wood."
Rustic aromas like earth and dried leaves are followed by rather lean red-cherry and rhubarb flavors in this medium-bodied wine.
"Bread-like, yeasty aromas adorn a simple thickness of smoky char, dark cherry and bold concentration in this wine, which seems heartier than the varietal tends to be."
"Stalky black currant fruit aromas and a spicy, stalky character on the palate define this tight, dry wine. It's young and tough now, so give it another year and drink from 2018."
"Heavily wood aged, this wine is tough and dry, with aggressive toast flavors. The concentration is there but is not from fruit."
"Overripe, jammy fruit aromas and flavors spoil this wine. It's oddly balanced: soft on the one hand and tough on the other."
"Smoky aromas from wood aging show again strongly in the tough wooden plank notes that dominate this wine. It's a shame, because the fruit is there."
"Firm tannins and overripe fruit dominate this wine. It will not develop well, with those tannins remaining tough."
"This wine has a smoky char quality and a decadent richness of cured meat and bacon grease. Light, it's dusted modestly in spice, with an herbaceous tease of tannin on the finish."
"This wine is flat and simple, with touches of herbaceous earthiness and cedar. Plum and blueberry-fruit flavors are welcoming if lacking in complexity, with the finish offering a hint of cinnamon."
"This wine is soft and somewhat disjointed, uncertain of its structure. Highlights are caramel-toffee oak and a tease of anise amongst blackberry and black current."
Strong spicy meaty aromas and equally assertive oak and char flavors threaten to overwhelm the fruity aspects of this dry wine but it has enough concentration to match the firm tannins. Best after 2020.
Heavily toasted charred oak aromas meet maple syrup flavors in this sweet and full-bodied wine. It is heavy on the oaky elements and light on natural-tasting fruit flavors.
"This is a fat, soft and smooth wine. It has juicy red fruit and acidity, with light tannins that lend support. It's ready to drink."
"Named after the many lighthouses which guide sailors on the French Atlantic coast, this soft and fruity wine is made from 100% Merlot. Crisp, with plenty of red fruit, it's light and ready to drink."
"This wine is an oak bomb, from the wood smoke and charcoal aromas to the heavily roasted toasted flavors and woody tannins that make for a drying finish."
"Jammy, overripe fruit does not help this wine. Its soft tannins and acidity provide some pleasure, but that clumsy fruit gets in the way."
"With its signature herbal aromas with tangy, grapefruit-like acidity, this wine is light, fruity and ready to drink."
"New wood aromas lead this toasty wine that has spice, high toast flavors and the smallest hint of fruit. If the producer had not been so enthusiastic with the oak, this could have been a good wine."
"Aromas of marionberry jam and smoke leap out of the glass, along with orange peel and wilted flower notes that seem a bit unsettled. The flavors are plump around the edges but light in the middle, with a mesquite note that distracts."
"This is an off-dry wine, soft with strawberry flavors that are balanced by crisp acidity. It is light and fruitya fine wine to drink as an apritif."
"Prickly aromas are ruled by pyrazines. This feels heavy and grabby, with a mouthfeel dictated by grape skins. Flat, salty white-fruit flavors finish wan, with a green note of bell pepper."
"This bright, fruity wine is crisp with acidity from the red-currant flavors. A blend of Aragones and Touriga Nacional, it is light with just a touch of tannin. Drink now."
"This wine has a hot-pink color, effusive strawberry and cherry aromas and then sweet fruit flavors that give a sugary impression on the palate. It's very simple in approach and low in alcohol."
"Herbal berry aromas are accompanied by scents of plastic and latex. On the palate, this feels round and basic. Salty, herbal black-fruit flavors finish chunky and obtuse, with mild bitter notes."
"Soft, fruity and gently ripe, this is a light, easygoing wine. It has a touch of pepper as well as strawberry fruit flavors. Drink now."
"This oak-aged blend of Malvasia, Ferno Pires and Viosinho is soft with light green and citrus fruits. There is a creamy texture as well as a touch of spice from the wood. Drink this now."
This is called sweet and that's what it is. The candied sweetness is balanced by some acidity to keep the wine crisp and fruity. It will be fine as an apritif. Drink now.
"A subtle pink color, worthy of Provence, marks this wine with its attractive acidity and soft texture. There is only a hint of tannin to remind that this raspberry-flavored wine comes from Syrah. It is crisp and ready to drink."
"Aromas of asphalt, milk chocolate and generic berry fruits come with notes of creosote and chimney. This feels tannic and a bit flat. Savory, rubbery berry flavors are roasted and taste like oak-based clove on the finish."
"Grassy, leathery aromas lack ripeness and concentration. In the mouth, this is high in acidity, with rough tannins. Leathery, lightly weedy plum and currant flavors finish herbal. This Tannat puts up noticeable green notes on the nose, palate and finish."
Aromas of mushroom and cedar are overpowered by cherry in the form of cough drops and Kool-Aid. Notes of sour cherry and unsweetened cranberry juice are set against piercing acidity. The flavors fall flat on the finish as the acidity rides on.
"This wine is earthy, peppery and grippy. It is hard to penetrate in its mix of spicy clove and sour fruit."
"Nutty, oaky and tart, this stainless steel-fermented white shows a shock of acidity wrapped around freshly cut grass and tropical flavors."
"Oak, vanilla and furry berry aromas are raisiny and overly sweet. This Ripasso from dried Tannat grapes weighs in heavy and feels rustic. Saturated toasty flavors of oak, prune and raisin finish dark, minty and chocolaty."
"This is a thick and somewhat heavy white wine, wrapped in oak and ripe concentrated fruit. The profile is baked apple and pear with a side note of Good & Plenty candy anise."
"This soft wine has a smooth texture and little in the way of tannins. That brings out its red fruit, juicy acidity and light spice notes. Ready to drink."
"Tropical aromas of lime and lychee are simple but also normal for Moscato. This semisweet still wine is a bit dilute, with flavors of sweet grass, green herbs and lychee."
This is an aromatic wine with generous fruit and soft tannins. Its wood aging has given the wine extra richness as well as spice. The wine is ready to drink.
"There's something overwhelmingly herbal and weedy about this wine, which shows a simple structure of tannin and lingering flavors of cherry cola."
"This blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is orange in color and smells neutral except for a note of orange peel. On the palate, this has a grabby skins-driven texture. Short flavors of stone fruits are chunky and clunky. Other than having a mild flavor of nectarine, the finish is neutral."
This is a full-bodied wine with lightly perfumed blackberry fruits and some firm tannins. It has some spice as well as juicy acidity. It can be drunk now.
"With caramel and red-fruit flavors, this is a crisp wine with a touch of sweetness. It is feather-light and ready to drink now."
"The wine shows simple red fruits, attractively displayed with minimum fuss or tannin. Bright red currant and berry flavors are joined by crisp acidity at the end. Drink now."
Carrot and herb aromas lead to semisweet and spicy flavors in this medium-bodied smooth-textured wine.
"The aromas are a bit unsettled, bringing a wilted-flower note that is off-putting. The ripe cherry, blackberry and smoky flavors seem disconnected. It doesn't all come together, and the variety seems impossible to find."
"This is rich in style and packed with jammy blackberry fruit and slightly green, sweet oak. It's a little hot and one dimensional, but those who enjoy a riper style of red will be satisfied."
"Named after an Arabic battle cry and now an expression that's shouted at wine festivals, the wine is lightly wood aged, ripe although with a stalky edge. It's easy and ready to drink."
"This wine's green, herbal character suggests underripe fruit. All bell pepper and spice flavors, the fruit seems left behind."
"This lean wine is high on acidity and structure. The fruit seems to be missing, needing more flesh to feel complete."
"Dark color and a punch of smoky oak underline this wine's big burly hold of tannin and ripe fruit. Tobacco, tar and baked cherry highlight the flavor wheel."
This medium-bodied wine has ripe and semisweet flavors like cherry juice and plum jam that give a soft impression on the palate.
"This wine starts on intense aromas of charred oak and roasted nuts. It eventually gives way to stone fruits and marmalade that, while soft on the nose, are stronger on the fruit-forward palate. Nutty flavors and rough oak seem out of place among the fresh fruit and viscous mouthfeel, and makes for a long yet disjointed finish."
"With the addition of 24% Merlot, this big burly red is simple and soft in its elements of cedar, graphite and soy. The fruit is black and jammy."
"An off-dry pair with the ros in this range, this is a soft white wine that is clean, fruity with attractive sweet pear and quince flavors. Drink now."
"This wine is marked by dry tannins and is smoky and toasty, with little sign of fruit. While it will soften, it will stay somewhat tough."
A heavy veneer of charred oak competes with a butterscotch candy element in the aromas and flavors of this frankly sweet wine.
This is a strongly perfumed wine with a curious barnyard flavor that hides the fruitiness. This spoils the tangy texture and acidity that are there in the back.
This wine has meaty aromas that lead into a bacon flavors. It has ample tannins but hardly any fruit.
"This wine is overwhelmingly smoky in char and bacon flavor, with a side note of herbal mint. Extracted, the oak is intrusive."
"Stale fruit and damp-earth aromas are a warning sign. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon is raw and acidic, with hard tannins. Lean plum flavors are oaky and resiny, while this feels scratchy on an intensely dry finish."
"This is a sturdy, dry wine that has a brownish color on the rim, roasted fruit aromas, subdued earthy meaty flavors and very full body."
"ber-simple and rather diluted, this offers sour cherry and notes suggesting sweet and sour sauce. It's vigorous with vivacious acidity."
"Odd aromas of burnt peanut and clove blend with murky fruit scents. This is raw and pulling on the palate, while clove and other oak-based flavors are front and center. Resiny oak and leftover clove notes push a hard finish. If you don't like clove, subtract a point or two from the score."
"Lightly perfumed, this is a simple, fruity wine that is ready to drink. It is floral, with a citrus flavor and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now."
"Noticeably sweet and quite soft in texture, this is an easygoing, simple and smoky-tasting wine with low acidity."
"Viognier makes up 61% of this wine. The aromas don't seem entirely pleasant, with notes of ale and herb. The palate brings a lightly oily feel to the stone-fruit flavors that also show some sweetness that isn't balanced by acidity."
"This blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot is bitter and astringent."
This earthy wine has barnyard aromas and a rough edge. The redeeming feature is the juicy black-currant fruit that provides a crisp aftertaste.
"Cut by a splash of Viognier, this ros is a dark-rust color in the glass, and smells of wet soil, black plum skins and a slight pepper spice. The sip is sweet, unctuous and bitter all at once, with sour orange, sugar plums and plum juice flavors."
"A scratchy, rough nose with forced creamy oak aromas is also a bit fiery and hot. A heavy palate with surface-level oak tastes more of clove and cured beef than honest fruit. A sticky, cloying palate is creamy and overtly oaky."
"This older wine seems to have lost some of its youthful appeal, showing older characteristics of caramelized oak and weedy herb. The structure is beginning to show a mushiness that causes the wine to fall somewhat apart."
"Resiny oak and wallflower fruit aromas lead to a palate that's thick and sticky. This tastes woody and barrel heavy, with little to no fruit. On the finish, a tropical note of banana is offset by briny saltiness."
"Heavily charred aromas are like a smoldering campfire. This is so drawing and dry on the palate that it borders on difficult. Salty oaky black-plum flavors are more savory than fruity, while this has no fruit left on the desert-dry severely tannic finish."
"This is a ptillant off-dry wine. It has a soapy character that is lifted by citrus fruits, a crisp texture and lively acidity. Drink immediately."
"Light green-apple aromas and crisp, almost neutral flavors leave this wine with a bland personality. It is dry and clean on the palate."
"Maple and clove aromas scream of oak, and not toasty, spicy oak. Following suit, this is creamy and less than fluent on the palate. Furthermore, this tastes of clove and creamy oak more than actual fruit."
the earthiness in this wine comes from the Castelo in the blend. It has ripe red-berry fruits that are cut with acidity and meaty flavors. The wine is softly structured and ready to drink.
This wine has unusually herbaceous aromas and touches of smoke and earth accenting the green-apple flavors. It's medium bodied and feels lean in texture.
"Oxidized aromas of vanilla, stale tropical fruits and canned pear syrup lead to a flabby palate with a heavy consistency. Oxidized melon flavors lean in the direction of tropical, while this is dull and chunky on the finish."
"Pale peach in color, this wine brings aromas of green pepper and jalapeo pepper that are quite strong. The palate is dry and brings more of the same. It just doesn't work."
"Harsh, fruitless aromas of green bean and ashtray come before a raw palate that's far from welcoming. Choppy, herbal plum flavors are grassy, while the finish offers nothing new or different."
"A lean wine with green fruit flavors, this is made drinkable by its balance between fruit and the dry core of tannins. The wine should be drunk now."
Sulfur and match stick aromas are less than pleasant and devoid of fruit. A flabby grabby palate deals oaky flavors of stale white fruits. A long but arduous finish doesn't help the situation.
"Aromas of sawmill and burnt wood are dominant. This feels resiny and sticky. Flavors of spiced apple are smothered by heavy-handed oak, while this is flat as a board and resiny tasting on the finish."
"This is a fat wine with ripe fruits and a strawberry flavors. The palate is dry, with a soft texture. Drink now."
"A nose based on candied fruit is pretty much the script for all of the Macaw reds. Like the others, this Merlot is sticky but also acidic. Flavors of raspberry Kool-Aid and foxy plum are mercifully short on the finish."
Kerosene aromas and a perfumed character come from the Malvasia in the blend. It is a perfumed wine with touches of green fruits and acidity. The wine doesn't quite hang together.
"Candied-raspberry aromas are soapy and strange. This sweet Tannat from Brazil is hollow yet cloying, with candied-cherry flavors that don't cut it. While not undrinkable, this just isn't good."
"This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020."
"This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020."
"There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestinessthere almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too. Drink 20222040."
"The heady aromatic scent of fresh tangerine peel takes turns with the refreshing perfume of green Seville oranges. The palate takes these enticing aromas and bundles them into one arrow-like force of concentrated freshness. This is a high-wire act of piercing brightness and layered citrus aroma. This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now. Keep this genie in its bottle for a while longer, if only to see what fascinating direction it takes. This is wondrous. Drink 20222037."
"Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser lightincisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean. Wait for this. Drink 20252040 at least."
"An earthy touch of freshly turned soil clings to the pure apple note on the nose. On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow. This is a real experience and a celebration of site and variety. Hoard this if you can. Gorgeous and fresh now, but far too young. Drink 20222040."
"The wine from this clos or walled vineyard in the city of Reims has spent eight years aging before disgorgement. It's a rare wine, with a wonderful balance between its toasty character and the crisp, dry apple and green-fruit flavors. It will certainly age further, so waitif you canuntil 2019."
"This fine vintage of Insignia combines 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Soft, supple and seamless, it offers rich but balanced cassis and milk chocolate flavors, with supportive and complementary oak. It should do well in the cellar and will be best from 20242034."
"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruitthink tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pearas well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 20182037."
"Whiffs of red-cheeked mirabelle plum, tart red apple, a touch of earth and vivid tangerine immediately signal pleasure. The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed. Let it age a while before playing it out. It will be worth the wait. Drink 20222037."
"The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintagethis is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine."
"Interestingly released after the softer 2009 version of this wine, this 2008 vintage is beautifully balanced between crisp fruit and ripe maturity. With its red fruits still in place, it also has a toasty yeasty edge that is sophisticated and enticing. It is a superb wine, delicious to drink now although because of the quality of the vintage it will age for many more years, certainly into the 2020s."
"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 20172037."
"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate. On its fringes, delicious hints of chamomile and chervil appear alongside ripe red apple. This is a tantalizing charmer in spite of its absolute dryness and vivid acidity. Drink 20172037."
"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 20182035."
"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 20252050."
"The fascinating nose of this wine is reason enough to seek it outan aromatic display of underripe raspberry, tart pomegranate, fresh dill, eucalyptus and sage. Montmorency cherry notes show on the palate, along with mace, Vietnamese cinnamon and fennel. A unique, refreshing and memorable wine."
"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbsthink chervil and yarrowalso make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 20222040."
"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 20202040."
"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 20172040 at least."
"Glorious and utterly enticing notes of peach hover on the nose. They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate. It's a most unusual and most beguiling Riesling with incredible appeal and potential. Drink 20172040."
"There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful. Its inherent grace will only increase with time. Drink 20202037."
"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 20172017."
"Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 20192030."
"This beautiful wine, with its poise, elegance and balance, has both a steely mineral core and an outer ripe-fruit character. It has citrus, tight acidity and rich apple and green-plum flavors. The wine is still a little young and will be better from 2019."
"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricotit's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish."
"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 20222028, though it could mature well even beyond."
"Perfectly baked red cherry aromas are dusted with cola, slate, olive, sumac and Middle Eastern spice on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. The palate expertly balances tight tannins, bright acidity and a vibrant energy to deliver tart raspberry, thyme, forest floor and roast beef flavors that sail into the zingy finish."
"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 20172035."
"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 20172037."
"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 20172035."
"Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 20172035."
"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 20172035."
"Definitely dry, this impressively crisp wine is tightly textured, mineral in character and with great fruit. Its acidity and taut tangy character are part of a sophisticated wine that is still maturing. The hints of toast are there, but this beautiful wine will take a while to show its full potential. Drink from 2019."
"Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 20172030."
"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lightera combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 20172027."
"A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin. All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness. There is drive here and an arrow-like structure that is energetic and totally refreshing. Uncompromising freshness, expressed with exuberant citrus charm, enlivens everything. The absolutely dry finish is invigorating and lasting. Drink 20182035."
"From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue."
"This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension."
"A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about thisit can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age. The pure, long and intense finish is a delicious promise. Drink 20172037."
"Just beginning to mature, this balanced, ripe wine is complex, with bright acidity, toast and pear and green-plum fruits. It is rich, with a tight mouse that shows intensity as well as a stylish character. This is a fine wine just coming into its own but well worth aging further until 2020."
"At 35-years-old, this golden wine may be old, but it is still glorious. Still honeyed, with hints of its past yellow and bitter-orange fruit still there, the wine is intense, with toast, almonds and a richness that is so concentrated. Drink now."
"Wild strawberry and plum mix with subtle yet sultry notes of nutmeg, mace, loam, graphite and game on the nose of this bottling. Sizzling acidity leads the palate, carrying cherry, plum and red apple flavors, followed by layers of eucalyptus and pine forest."
"Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Cte des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further."
"Beautifully delineated fruit constitues the nose, with ripe, yellow plum playing alongside crisp, green apple. The palate layers a sonorous tone of sourdough bread with rich hints of yeast, green-apple briskness and gentle yellow plum. The notions unite with the fizzing, fine mousse. On the midpalate and the finish, the depth of this wine becomes clear: Profound and rich but in a totally slender, unassuming and convincing fashion. The finish is pure and lasting. Drink 20172027."
"Clean lines of nectarine, lemon blossom, orange sorbet and wet rock show on the lovely nose of this bottling from Trey Fletcher. Boisterous energy and a chalky grip power the palate, where citrus freshness dominates, and the acidity is powerful but not overblown. It will age with beauty and grace. Drink 20182035."
"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruita mlange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034."
"This new cuve is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best."
"A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 20192037."
"The musky touch of botrytized fruit appears immediately, adding even more allure to the golden color. An explosion of golden apricot and luscious peach provide mouthfilling sweetness on the palate. All this is countered by very concentrated lemon freshness. This is not one of the tooth-achingly sweet SGNsthis is fresher and still has vivid fruit flavors. The finish has so much freshness it is lip-smacking. This will be a killer with fruit-centered desserts. Its sweetness-acid balance is of utter poise and a wonderful class act. Drink 20172050."
"Brine and oak accents cradle this impressive wine's elegant green apple, wet stone and lime notes. Bold and concentrated yet complex, it's balanced by lively acidity and persistent freshness."

"The nose of this bottling explodes with exotic cherry scents and compelling strokes of iron, rose, carnation and cinnamon. It's refreshingly tart and earthy on the palate, where dewy sage, mint and tarragon touches lift its youthful raspberry and green olive flavors. Easy to guzzle, yet intriguingly complex."
"The nose at first is all about aromatic orange zest but with a little more air there are lovely hints of jasmine and honeysuckle. The palate adds a judicious bitterness and counters this with residual sweetness. The counterpoint here is between texture and full fruit. This is incredibly powerful, as if some inner force was at work. This seems like a genie in a bottlewillful, driven and deliciously aromatic. The finish is off dry and long. Lovely now but sure to last. Drink 20172040."
"A funky whiff of yeast has to blow off before wonderfully pure orange zest notes appear. The palate has a wonderful richness of texture, something earthy with a pithy, beautiful grip. The flavors are still taut, for now (just zesty aromatic orange peel) but much more still hides and sleeps below the surface. This is powerful and concentrated, with a lovely and enduring backbone of freshness. This needs bottle age to come into its own. The finish is fresh, clean and lasting. Drink 20202037."
"A touch of luscious peach plays among the ripe lemon notes of the nose. A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish. Drink 20172030."
"This estate, owned by the same family since 1787, has amazing stocks of old sweet wines maturing in its cellars. With red apple, honey and apricot aromas, this wine, mature and yet so fresh, is proof of the aging ability of Chenin Blanc. It is the balance between the ripe honeyed flavors and the intense acidity that keeps it so vibrant. Drink this superb wine now."
"A tender but enticing touch of peach rises from the glass. There also is a glint of smoke and a touch of lemon zestiness. It is lemon and tangy citrus that takes over on the taut linear palate. Zestiness fizzes and gives the concentrated palate a wonderfully weightless feel that belies the depth of fruit. This is totally appetizing and refreshing with a dry, moreish finish. Drink 20172035."
"Heady notes of chamomile and dried hay flower stream from the glass immediately hinting at a wine with some evolution. A touch of candied lemon peel makes the nose even more enticing. The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity. Savored slowly, the full depth of pure pear fruit becomes apparent. This is a class act just coming into its drinking window now, with ample potential for further aging. Drink 20172035."
"A funky earthy touch hovers on the nose before hints of nettle and lemon balm add an aromatic edge to lemon freshness. On the exquisitely dry palate, it is the vivid, bright and intense lemon freshness that takes over, but those earthier notes still flash up around the edges, adding interest and depth. They will unfurl more as time passes. While this is linear, incisive and precise now, it will truly shine with bottle age. Drink 20172037."
"This head-turning wine was made from vines planted in the 1970s and 1990sa selection that shocks with its complex beauty. Pine forest and Christmas spice notes accent cranberry, rhubarb and tart citrus flavors, all seemingly infused with seductive smoke. At its juicy core is an earthy, mushroomy component."
"This classic Napa Cabernet is juicy in explosive black cherry and cassis flavors that pair with firm, integrated tannin and an elegant structure. The oak is restrained, contributing complementary baking-spice accents. Long and sublime on the finish. Best from 20242040."
"Now at its peak, this impressive wine has moved from fruit to maturity, adding toastiness to its acidity and giving the wine richness. It's full and ripe while keeping the taut, steely edge proper to a Chardonnay Champagne. There's no need to age further. Drink now."
"Made from equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this still young Champagne is rich in the Taittinger style, with an elegant poise that is impressive. The wine, with its apricot and ripe apple fruit, is generously tempered by bright acidity and a crisp edge. Drink from 2021."
"This impressive dry wine is made as part of a club of producers who taste and evaluate each other's wines before release. A blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it is full of white fruit with a toasty edge that gives the wine weight. Behind this is a strongly mineral character with bite and zest that will allow it age further. Drink from 2020."
"From an organic parcel of vines, this floral and honey-flavored wine is superbly rich. The 12 months in wood adds spice and a touch of toast as well as giving the wine a delicious oxidative edge. It is an opulent wine, hinting at honey, with ripe melon and quince flavors. Drink this impressive wine from 2021."

The finish is ultraclean and gorgeously lip-smacking. Totally refreshing now but with great potential. Drink 20172037.
"The nose is a little shy, just hinting at citrus freshness. The very dry palate brings all the freshness to the forethis is lithe and vividly lemony. Exquisite tartness tingles deliciously on the tongue and ripples its vivid rays of shimmering bright light across the senseswhat a picture of 2014. If you like it emollient and rounded this is not for you. This is for lovers of bright uncompromising purity and freshness. This has real verve, bags of it, all backed up with serious lemon fruit. Gorgeously refreshing now but it will be even better with time. Drink 20172037."
"A very shy closed nose gives little away but the palate reveals all. A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal liftchamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty. Alluring now but absolutely certain to become spectacular with some age. The finish is totally dry, aromatic and long. Drink 20172037."
"Hay flowers, honey and ripe yellow pear create an alluring nose. The palate adds even more fruit, with juicy mirabelle and peach carried by boost of residual sugar. This richness is aptly countered by lemon and tangerine zest. This joyful exuberant medium-sweet wine has a tightrope balance and incredibly deep and rich dimensions of fruit. The finish is lasting and pure. Drink 20172037."
"With its high-toned sparkle of lemon zest and orange, this lovely wine evolves to show rich oak and apple pie notes, evoking baked Gravenstein apple, cinnamon and nutmeg. Medium-bodied, it wears its concentration of flavor and texture well, finding a well-earned balance through the lengthy finish."
"Austin Hope's latest releases are all about power and ripeness, and this blend of 35% Grenache, 35% Mourvdre and 30% Syrah achieves balance and elegance amidst that strength.

Steady acidity and finely chiseled tannins frame it all."
"Dried lemon peel and hay flowers make for an inviting nose. On the palate, the vivid brightness of lemon brightens notes of tart apple and the merest touch of earth and stone.

Clearly a vintage for adults only. The finish is lip-smackingly clean and utterly moreish. Drink 20172037."

Warmth is palpable on this rather luscious, incredibly generous and still-evolving wine. The finish is beautifully corralled into zesty sweetness by ripe lemon. This is layered and complex and must be savored slowly. It will continue to develop. Drink 20172027."

Blackberry, clove and leather flavors rise to the fore. Cellar through 2035."
"Only one barrel of this Paul Hobbs-consulted bottling was produced, and that extreme focus made for a powerful and rich though not overripe result. Concentrated blackberry and violet aromas are cut by crushed gravel and cedar spice notes. Leather, tobacco, rose petal and black pepper accents spice up its black fig flavors on the hearty palate, which is structured with fine-grained tannins."
"This amazing wine, gold in color, is one of the treasures that appear from time to time from the underground cellars of this great producer. It is old, but its sweetness has not been impaired by age. Rather the sweetness has become intense richness and intense acidity. The wine, full and opulent, is, of course, ready to drink."
"There is almost a touch of burnt sugar on the nose before the more customary aromas of juicy honeyed pear kick in. There are fresher glints, too, of zesty lime and green pear. The palate boosts the juicy pear notes which fill mouth and nose and which are edged with pleasantly bitter pithiness. A touch of residual sweetness amplifies the fruit on the generous palate, but this is balanced with lemony freshness before an off-dry finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 20172030."

This is lovely now but has huge promise. Drink 20172037."
"Paix Sur Terre manages to translate the heat and sunshine of Paso Robles into a rich and savory but not overripe wine.

The palate is dense and creamy, with dark chocolate, roasted blackberry, vanilla and caramel flavors."

It is a beautifully balanced wine that is ready to drink."

"Mumm has always had a special relationship with the Chardonnay village of Cramant, and this new vintage reinforces that. It brings out both richness and minerality in a fine, generous blend. It comes from grand cru vineyards, ripe in its creamy apple character and the beginnings of maturity. Drink from 2018."
"El Enemigo winemaker/owner Ale Vigil is the master of Cab Franc in Mendoza, and this wine tops the charts. After some heat on the nose blows off, chili powder, leather, black-olive and black-fruit aromas settle in. This feels grabby and intense, while roasted, spicy black-plum and blackberry flavors are initially aggressive on the finish before turning more exotic and complex. Drink through 2026; contains 15% Malbec."
"Zesty notes of tangerine are met with earthier hints of russet pear peel on the open appetizing nose. The palate shines with even brighter citrus appealthink tangerine and tart blood orange with a wonderfully vivid lemon streak. This is linear and concentrated, utterly refreshing and lively.

"Redcurrant and cranberry vie for attention, while a slightly wilder notion of rosehip creates a lifted aroma with an edge of aromatic tisane, hinting at some evolution. The palate confirms this with rich oatmeal and biscuit, a touch of honey and the alluring brightness of both fresh and candied lemon peel. This wine is slender but profound, with just the right amount of evolution. It's serious enough to take on subtle foods. The finish is rich but never lets go of its briskness."
"A shy, just about citrus-scented nose takes a little air to be woken up before releasing a strikingly pure note of ripe lemon. The palate has the same clear lemon purity but has a rich fluid texture of ripeness and concentrationa wonderful interplay of fruit richness and taut freshness that creates tension and poise. While the palate is completely dry, the lemon depth attains the richness of lemon oil and candied zest. The tanginess lingers long on the pure finish. This is lovely and pure now, but bottle age will make it beguiling. Drink 20172037."
"A wonderfully savory touch of fragrant wild thyme precedes the tangerine peel notes on the nose of this promising and aromatically scented wine. The palate comes through with tangy zesty tangerine and bright fresh lemon. This is streamlined and taut, muscular but svelte. This just fills palate and mind with its fizzing, vibrant citrus notes that shine on the absolutely dry concentrated palate. Lots of refreshment and excitement here. Drink 20172030."
"Honeyed richness hits the nose directly. This is followed by citric freshness and ripe notions of juicy pear. The palate has a touch of residual sweetness but also a wonderful blast of lemony freshness that brightens and enlivens this lovely, developing wine. It is this lemony purity, edged with notions of candle wax and candied zest that gives this such a youthful, lip-smacking and clean finish. This has only just begun to develop. It's ready now but with further potential. Drink 20172035."
"The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 20172030."
"This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 20172030."

"Winemaker Matt Crafton embraces the winery's longstanding tradition of elegant Napa Valley Cabernet in this estate winea beautiful expression of exotic, savory characteristics wrapped in a seamless texture. Tomato leaf, meat and soy notes underscore deep layers of black pepper, black cherry and cassis, with grippy, dense tannins. Enjoy 20232033."
"Lush and lovely fruits highlight this wine. White peaches, lemon curd, sweet pineapple, quince and a dash of honey all combine gracefully, with a nice kick of fresh acidity. A light touch with new French oak (20%) adds a hint of vanilla and Key-lime pie to the finish. On the second day, it's just as good, if not even better."
"Almost entirely Chardonnay, with just a whisper of Pinot Noir, this is a dry Champagne. It is crisp, lively, steely and with great intensity. The apple and lemon flavors are just a part of this impressive wine that could age longer. Drink from 2019."
"A touch of earth and the purest expression possible of tart ripe red apple immediately draws you in on the nose. The absolutely dry palate also has a touch of that earthiness and adds more apple-peel notions to the fruit while a vivid lemon brightness takes center stage. This is generous and earthy in a typically Alsatian idiom but then that freshness kicks in and takes this to another level. It channels and guides all the energy and power of this site into alluring dynamics on the palate. The finish is dry, long and lovely. Drink 20172030."
"Superripe mirabelles and the juiciest pears appear on the nose and fill the mind with heady perfume. The palate confirms this notion of sweetness with ample residual sugar. However, this is met with precise acidity to create unusual thrill. This just sits on a knife's edge between juicy ripe pear and mouth-watering grapefruit zesta wonderful interplay of notions that makes this incredibly enticing. This is starting to develop and has way to go with its playful, medium-dry finish. Drink 20172030."
"The nose is rather restrained but the palate comes alive with ripe lemon and zesty tangerine. This is dry and concentrated, with a lovely vein of lemon freshness that pervades and brightens the entire experience. Prepare to be refreshed. This is luminous, fresh and so illustrative of the 2014 vintage: A challenge that yielded such jewels in the right hands. Lovely now but with ample mileage. Drink 20172037"
"Wet stone and lemon set the tone when it comes to scent. The palate falls in with these themes and presents precision and poise; the razor-sharp freshness of lemon zest is both brightening and deliciously bracing. This is a svelte but concentrated wine of great purity that has not really come into its own yet. It is perfumed now but one cannot help but suspect much more development of aroma in the future. All the potential, concentration and balance is there. The finish is dry and lemony. Drink 20172030."
"Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 20172037."
"Dried lemon peel and honey create a very appealing nose. The palate displays generous fruit balanced by the disciplined structure provided by lively acidity. Glimpses of ripe pear and honeycomb show on the edges, while the medium-dry finish is immensely appetizing. Though it's lovely now, it shows long-term potential, and should hold well through 2030."
"A toasty touch of brioche joins ripe red and yellow-apple notes on the nose. The palate has even more of that autolytic richness, grounding both tart red apple and ripe lemon notes. Fine and creamy, the mousse highlights the fruit freshness while an earthier, toastier, richer background shimmers through enticingly. This harmonious and complex sparkler majors on beautiful development and pristine freshness. Lovely now, it is certain to develop further. Drink 20172025."
"Evocative redcurrant notes play on the nose. They become more intense on the palate where lively fizz lets them mix with lemon and pink grapefruit zestiness. This wine is lively and fresh but the exuberant surface is supported by a firm and taut structure of subtle autolysis that provides the perfect backdrop for all the tart, refreshing berry fruit. It offers freshness, joy and verve in one tidy, neat package. Lovely now, it will develop. Drink 20172025."
"A touch of quince plays about the rich notes of peach and tangerine on the nose. An aromatic notion of dark fir honey leads onto a medium-sweet palate of ripe peach, zesty tangerine peel, golden mirabelles and lemon. The citrus elements provide a high-toned brightness that works very well with the sweet juiciness and richness of the palate. On the palate it is the wonderfully aromatic zestiness that lasts and lasts."
"Restrained notes of tart red berry and pink grapefruit play on the nose of this wine. The palate is taut but has an appetizing touch of wet stone along with fresh, fruity notes and a mellow but bright autolytic core that creates a harmonious impression. Tiny bubbles fizz away beatifically, sure in the knowledge that they go straight to your heart. This is quietly convincing, just being its very elegant self."
"Stunningly good, this offers off-dry numbers (13g/L) but plenty of high acid tang. Honeysuckle, tart citrus, green apple and honeycomb start it out, and the wine kicks into more and more gears with superb concentration and depth. Lemon verbena and lemon-tea flavors come into the extended finish, with light tannins and superb details. Drink now through 2035."
"This powerfully built, youthful wine was made from coastal fruit grown in Susanna's Vineyard. Brawny and smoky, it offers a concentrated black-cherry note that takes on a refined, baked quality. The fruit is cradled in soft, seductive acidity and a hint of leather."
"A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose. This rich sweet-fruited tropicality is played out fully on the medium-sweet palate where the passion fruit swirls tartly alongside sweet ripe generous peach. It is the passion-fruit aroma and tartness that gives this a real edge. This not only has sweetness but a real tropical thrill. It's a very concentrated, pure-fruited wine with lots of promise. Drink 20172027."
"The aromatic richness of ripe pears rises from the glass. The same rich fruit is joined by a lively streak of lemon freshness on the palate where it is met with a judicious dollop of residual sweetness. This wine plays off generous, juicy ripeness with tingling, tart freshness and creates a delicious balancing act. The finish is zesty and just off dry and wonderfully moreish."
"Subtle but persistent notes of ripe pear, sandalwood and mirabelle appear on the nose. The palate is powerful and concentrated, weighing in with bundled notes of ripe orange zest that lend bright structure to an abundance of pear and earth notes. This is a big ripe wine, full flavored and potent. It has barely begun its trajectory and will acquire even more spice and allure over the years. This really is one to lay down. Drink 20202030."
"A touch of salted caramel appears before the flesh of ripe yellow apples takes over on the nose. The palate sings with freshness and presents a mousse of tiny pin-prick bubbles. The spicy but rich notion of salted caramel tantalizes again on a bone-dry palate. This wine is both weightless and profound, with lovely length and a lip-smacking finish."
"Tiny amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot were added to this succulent, elegant wine with cassis, cranberry and black cherry flavors and rounded structure. A light note of cocoa dust and soft texture balance its exotically spiced lushness with delicious integration."
"This rich, delicious wine is still bursting with young apple and grapefruit flavors, giving it a fruity start with great long-term potential. Then the concentration and the richly mineral texture kicks in, lending the wine intensity and the possibility of aging. Drink from 2019."
"The pithy, appetizing notion of russet pear peel entices on the nose, alongside the juicy ripeness of yellow pears. The palate has a rich earthy profound juiciness where generous pear fruit is countered by a pleasantly bitter edge. Notions of sandalwood spice glint in the distance. There is something warming, powerful and generous about this rich wine but the finish remains dry. This will benefit from bottle age. Drink 20202035."
"While the nose is plush and tropical, there's elegance and restraint on the palate of this complex dry Riesling. It's delicate in body, yet its honeyed lemon and tangerine flavors are bold and penetrating. The finish is long and edged in steel, with a pleasantly astringent kick of lime zest. Beautiful already, it should improve through the next decade."
"Fragrant overtones of acacia honey play alongside lemony notes on the nose, adding a touch of restrained, exotic decadence. A hint of chalk contributes grounding dimension. All combine to make a fragrant nose. These themes play out again on the slender but expressive palate. Pure lemon freshness brightens the notions of honey and chalk, while tiny bubbles provide endless explosions of deep, sustained flavor. This wine seems still young and taut, but the energy suggests great future development. Lemon purity on the finish appeals with its clean and invigorating nature. Drink 20172027."
"This Syrah is Terre Rouge's flagship, and it lives up to its reputation with more complexity and spiciness than the other wines in the portfolio.

Full bodied and memorable, it has wonderful layering and a lingering, spicy finish."
"This wine is velvety smooth, thick and savorya complex and nuanced celebration of a great site that's meticulously farmed. It unspools black tea, clove and spicy cola flavors as it opens."
"Just as it says on the label, this is a nonvintage wine that has aged longer than usual in the Lanson cellars (in this case five years). That immediately gives it a toasty aroma and palate. The white stone fruit is still crisp although filled out and rounded with bottle age. Drink this impressive wine now."
"This bottling from Fintan du Fresne has all the hallmarks of savory, cool-climate Syrah: deep blackberry aromas wrapped in black pepper, rosemary, game and tar. The palate adds pine and boysenberry to the mix, making for a compelling and lively wine."
"Dark in color, this wine packs deep blackberry and boysenberry aromas together with violet, allspice and sandalwood. The palate is redolent of licorice and nutmeg, wrapped in an unrelenting texture that lets the black plum and lilac flavors just peek out. Time will allow this to blossom. Drink 20192034."
"Pure notes of red apple rise from the glass, promising freshness, tart briskness and mellow fruit. A hint of shortbread conveys body and generosity. All of this comes together on the rounded palate that has the aromatic lift of rosehip tisane. Mellow autolysis gives the central freshness a generous background. Red-berry fruit flashes amidst the red-apple notes with appetizing tartness. This is a rounded but compact package that takes freshness onto a higher, elegant plane, finishing with enticing saltiness. Lovely now, it's sure to develop. Drink 20172027."
"The nose is not inclined to give much away at this early stage. The palate, however, freely gives wonderfully tart apple fruit that has a juicy ripeness and the tang of lemon. The palate is dry and streamlined, with a wonderfully racy focus of freshness and concentration. Yet this remains svelte and toned. It is the lemony tang that creates such a deliciously lip-smacking and refreshing finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 20172027."
"A subdued nose gives glints of earthy smoke and citrus zest. It is on the palate that soaring notes of ripe Amalfi lemon tangerines appear. This is ripeness expressed within a taut firm frame of acidic bright structure. The palate is concentrated and linear, the finish is dry and lasting. The citrus aromas gain something of apple towards the finish. Wonderfully fresh. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 20172035."
"This is a floral, mineral wine, both tight and exuberant in its perfumed character. Green apple and spices combine with the textured character of this balanced winelively, fruity and with fine acidity. It comes in a bottle that was common in the Victorian era, slightly narrower at the base."
"This wine carries aromas of white blossom in the dusk and freshly ripened stone fruit. The palate continues on this dreamy note, enveloping the tart-ripe freshness of red apples and a touch of citrus. The fruit is remarkably ripe and fresh for a wine from the 2012 vintage. The just off-dry palate hides nothing and just charms and entices. Lovely, dreamy, pure flavors from start to long, long finish. Drink 20172030."
"The yellow-fruited richness of mirabelle compote with a touch of vanilla becomes apparent on the nose. The palate is just as luscious as promised but also carries a welcome, thrilling streak of lemon oil at its core, brightening and framing the medium-sweetness with its zesty lift. A touch of pleasant phenolic bitterness can just about be felt, adding dimension to the palate. This is intriguing and exciting in the way it plays with richness and sweetness while keeping them on a very tight rein. Lovely. Drink 20172027."
"A lifted lemon-scented nose of peach gives and impression of ease and lightness. The palate, however, lays on generous sweetness to focus on ripe juicy peach notes. There is a huge concentration of flavor and richness, countered by that lemony freshness. This is a big but gentle wine that leaves your mind ringing with peach and lemon and a touch of honeysuckle spice. The medium-sweet finish is long and balanced. Drink 20172017."
"Peach and honeysuckle already have a notion of honeyed sweetness and ripeness on the nose. The palate boosts both fruit and floral notion to the top, where honeysuckle and rose petal notes meeting with peach on the medium-sweet palate. This is full on, joyous, juicy and rich with expressive, exuberant flavor. An underlying concentration almost feeds this with a fiery dynamic force. The finish is medium sweet but comes with a wonderfully redeeming pure lemon streak. This is ready now but will get even better with age. Drink 20172037."
"A touch of freshly cut apple peel is all that appears on the shy nose. The palate is more approachable and opens into beautifully aromatic notions of ripe tart apples and blossom. This has a very harmonious balance and something like tender poise. This is absolutely fresh but it comes like a caress, touching and convincing with tenderness rather than flashy force. The palate is dry, has ample and aromatic apple fruit and immense charm. This is so easy to drink right now but will certainly evolve. It finishes with a long pure echo of lemon. Drink 20172027."
"Beautifully aromatic notes of ripe citrus peel rise from the glassthink tangerine and juicy clementine. These flavors become more zesty on the full-flavored, concentrated but linear palate.

There is great balance, lasting length and beautiful poise. Drink 20172025."

The wine is beautiful, full-flavored and exciting with a long just-off-dry finish. Drink 20172027."

These wonderfully herb-scented notions continue on the exemplary dry palate: Imagine a lick of scented, dried chamomile embracing notions of dried and fresh apple and citrus peel.

Its fruit is wild and brambly, recalling blackberry and dark cherry with enviable succulence."

A lovely balancing act with a bracingly clean, medium dry finish and echoes of citrus zest. Drink 20172035."

"Named after the caves where the estate's wines are aged, this is the vineyard's top wine.

That same aromatic zesty touch pervades the entire palate, perfuming the rich ripe pear fruit and providing a wonderfully bright firm structure.

Right now all the notions are primary and delicious but this will evolve and develop. The concentration certainly is there. Drink 20172035."

Fiercely tannic, it builds in sweet flavors as it opens, recalling graham cracker, marshmallow and chocolatea children's treat in a glass. The texture is leathery and wholly satisfying."
"A restrained but pure note of lemon constitutes the nose, suggesting both tangy zest and juicy flesh. The subtle mousse of tiny bubbles and a sonorous backdrop of autolysis counters all of this freshness and allows it to blanket the senses with its shimmering, lemony but also creamy briskness. That luminous lemon core leaves a lasting impression on the palate. Purity, slenderness and elegance are its hallmarks. Lovely now this wine will age with grace. Drink 20172025."
"A touch of yeast still clings to the beautifully fresh apple nose of this wine while the palate still tingles with some residual carbon dioxide. This is rather young but the fruit is very pure in crisp green-apple notes and fresh, tangy lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and very taut and fresh. Some yeasty notes also swing along on the palate. This certainly needs bottle age but promises to become a lemon-scented, fresh and linear marvel. It certainly has bags of tension and freshness. The finish is bright, refreshing and utterly clean."
"This wine is rich to the edge of voluptuousness. Delicious nutty, toasty and buttery flavors are wrapped around ripe apricot and papaya fruit. A full-bodied, complex wine, it was aged for a year in 55% concrete eggs, 25% stainless and 20% French oak barrels."
"A touch of blossom honey enriches the tart but ripe apple notes of the nose. On the palate that honeyed touch turns into lemony, golden shortbread while the tart apple notes are joined by fresh, ripe lemon. Thousands of tiny, pin-prick bubbles make for a creamy, elegant mousse. The contrast between honeyed, autolytic richness and bright, pure citrus is a joy. This wine is exciting and elegant, drawing you to its mellower, richer core. The purity on the finish is luminous and long."
"Made from grapes grown in the Ritchie Vineyard, as well as others, this rich, mineral-laden expression of the variety is balanced and savory, with a touch of salty brine. Golden-hued, it shows complexity and focus, with a nuanced palate laced with apple skin and pear notes."
"Made from three vineyards within the appellation, this displays exemplary blending. Slightly reductive now, in its youth, it effortlessly melds together dark blackberry, strawberry and chocolate flavors, with a surly shock of pine forest-like earthiness. Decadent and velvety."
"An earthy touch of yeast plays promisingly on the nose. The palate then comes in with a concentrated load of ripe peach, bright lemon and rounded rose perfume. An edge of dark fir honey adds even more spicy richness. This brims with flavor, showing rich fruit against fresh lemon. There is lots of excitement here but also balance. This is a rich warming generous wine. Drink 20172027."
"The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 20172030 at least."
"Creamy, almost mellow notes of ripe yellow apple constitute the nose. The palate intensifies that creaminess with hints of vanilla and burnt sugar as well as with a finely fizzing, creamy mousse. All this is countered and balanced by sprightly freshness. Overall it conveys an opulent, hedonistic style, with an expressive and long finish reminiscent of salted caramel."
"Blended with 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is treated as a reserve-tier bottling. It delivers high-toned red fruit and plum notes dusted with spice and dried herb. It's robust in body and weight and long on the finish."
"Sizzling acidity enlivens the succulent, juicy fruit in this lush expression of the appellation. Made from grapes sourced in the Olivet Lane area, it builds in exotic spiciness, with forest, herb, earth and tea accents that grace the foundation of strawberry and blackberry flavors."
"This bold, spicy, well-structured makes a big impact on the palate. Cedar, clove and black pepper aromas lead to rich, ripe blackberry and dried plum flavors, while firm tannins and good acidity lend both grip and texture. Known to age well, this wine will be best after 2022."
"Named after the daughter of owner Alain Thinot, this elegant Champagne from grapes grown on the Montagne de Reims is just reaching maturity. It shows structure as well as ripe white fruits, with a citrus background. Drink now."
"Lithe yet concentrated, this gorgeous Sptburgunder balances crisp-tart blackberry and cherry flavors against shades of earth, game and dusty minerality. Zesty cranberry acidity and fine grained, persistent tannins lend four-square structure. The finish lingers on a rich, umami tone. It drinks beautifully already but should improve through 2025."
"This is the producer's longstanding ode to historic field blends, from a site in the Napa Valley planted to handfuls of mysterious varieties. The result is intriguing and unique, evoking fresh dough, plum and blackberry cobbler, the texture thick, soft and spicy. A thread of white floral perfume courses throughout."
"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now."
"A shy, floral nose subtly emanates from the glass in this lightly built, elegant expression from the spectacular vineyard in the Petaluma Gap. Anise, sea salt and preserved lemon flavors form its foundation; subtle oak and tense acidity provide support."
"The latest release in this series of wines with its Belle Epoque bottle is, as always, a blend dominated by Chardonnay. So although the dosage is relatively high, that is balanced by fine acidity and minerality. It is a stylish wine, ripe and with the maturity to drink now."
"This stellar blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is woven together with care, revealing an earthy bouquet of leather and compost. Old World in style, with its light approach and elegant underpinnings, it offers layers of clove, black pepper and graphite flavors within a balanced frame."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a bold, concentrated and flavorful wine that will mature well over the next 10 years. Aromas of espresso, crme de cassis, spiced blackberry, boysenberry preserves, tobacco and woodspice abound and carry through to the robust, gripping palate. It's firmly structured, but harmonious in it's overall strength, with final notes of campfire, char and cocoa on the long finish."
"Big, brawny tannins carry wave after wave of ripe black cherry, cola and clove flavor in this ethereal, earthy wine. Its velvety texture is rich and rewarding, balanced by a persistent thread of acidity and a tease of ash."
"A tender but perfumed hint of honeysuckle appears first on the nose, followed by rich peach hints. These notions persist on the palate where the peach and ripe yellow-plum notes are boosted by residual sweetness and countered by phenolic, slightly zesty but pleasant bitterness. You can feel the warmth on the medium-sweet finish. This is full on and rich, almost unctuousperfect for blue cheeses."
"Alluring scents of hawthorn, citrus blossom and ripe orchard fruit come together on this lovely sparkler. On the dry palate, nectarine zest and crushed herbs underscore a core of yellow apple and Bartlett pear. It's well balanced, with vibrant acidity and a creamy mousse that lends finesse."
"Perfectly mature, this ripe wine with its fruit from premier cru vineyards is balanced. The touches of toast go with the still-vibrant white fruits and acidity. With a richly textured background, the wine is ripe and deliciously ready to drink."
"BlackJack is sourced from the oldest block in the vineyard, planted in 1965 by original owner Charles Coury. This clone, rumored to have arrived from France in a suitcase, is named for him. This new release, still young and integrating the French oak (14 months, 30% new), offers black-cherry fruit with barrel toast and coffee flavors. Drink now through 2028."
"This elegant and tightly wound Grenache shows hints of black plum, boysenberry and blackberry alongside dried rose petal, gravel and sagebrush scents. The palate is effusively floral, with lilac and lavender flavors accenting an exotic backdrop of damson plum. The structure is firm and the acidity judicious."
"This wine is all Dijon clone, aged in two- to four-year-old puncheons. Bright and aromatic, it opens with a toasty scent and a mix of lemony citrus, pineapple and banana fruit. It's smooth and delicious and nicely layered, with an enduring finish."
"From the cru village of Chteau Thbaud, this wine with its five years of aging has reached a happy peak maturity. Perfumed and rounded, its fruit has changed into almonds and spice while keeping a strongly mineral texture. It is a fine wine that is ready to drink now."
"Dandelion, earthiness and apple peel appear vividly on the nose, and a certain creaminess can also be discerned. The off-dry palate is incredibly fruity and boosts the sweetness of deliciously ripe apples while remaining absolutely tart and fresh. The finish is dry and fresh but this will echo any sweet element in an otherwise savory dish. Delicious and long. Drink 20172035."
To age an extra brut vintage before release is a great idea. It leaves a wine that hints at toasty aromas as well as still-crisp fruitiness. The apple and pear flavors are filled out by the tangy edge and the hints of maturity to come. Drink this fine vintage now.
"Aromatically, this wine is still shy on nose and palate. Underneath that the linearity and inherent slenderness of ripe tangerine flesh and zest come though, enriched with an earthy notion of ripe pear. The palate is dry and energetic, but also still rather closed. The true colors are revealed on the finish, with a lasting pear note bundled on the concentrated, linear palate. Drink 20192030."
"Now approaching maturity although certainly not leaving its fruit behind, this is a fine structured wine. It has hints of toastiness as well as spice while keeping bright acidity and a tangy texture. The wine is rich still tense and ready to drink."
"This is a delicious, memorable wine that does the vineyard justice, offering layers of baked strawberry fruit tempered by moderate acidity. As it slowly opens, it reveals rose petal, cherry and pomegranate flavors, its texture broad yet defined."
"This gorgeous sparkler offers enticing scents of white stone fruit and spring flower. Vibrant and silky, the smooth elegant, palate delivers crisp apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine set against bright acidity and an ultrarefined perlage."
"There is almost something of the sea breeze in this wine. An alluring iodine hint on the nose mixes with notions of green apple and the merest touch of rhubarb. The palate comes in with a smooth, fine mousse of tiny, creamy bubbles that counterpoint the inherent English briskness. Slender and elegant, the palate gears everything to a fresh finish of green apple and lemon purity that lingers. It's harmonious, refreshing and balanced."
"This black-fruited offering has the winery's signature stamp all over it, with a vein of herb and wet rock that slices through the aromas and into the palate. Tangy acids prop up the blackberry and black-cherry fruit, and suggest that this can age. Drink now through 2030 at least."
"Very dark in the glass, this drought-hammered bottling (from a yield of just two-thirds of a ton per acre!) shows deep and concentrated black plum, black currant and licorice aromas but retains the wild thyme and dark mint character typical of Central Coast Pinot Noir. The palate combines richness with strong acidity, its concentrated black cherry fruit cut with tart plum skin notes."
"This barrel selection is the winery's reserve. Dense and detailed, it moves gracefully from lime-inflected citrus through peach and papaya. Though modest in alcohol, it has a warm kick to the finish, along with a light kiss of barrel toast."
"Delicate scents of white spring flower and white stone fruit curl out of the glass. This is loaded with finesse, delivering creamy white peach, green apple, pear and citrus. Vibrant acidity lends balance while an elegant perlage gives it an irresistibly silky texture."
"Fermented in the bottle, this beautiful wine opens with delicate scents of citrus blossom, white stone fruit and a whisper of thyme. Loaded with finesse, the bright silky palate displays Anjou pear, Rennet apple and lemon zest alongside an elegant perlage. Crisp acidity gives it a pristine refreshing finish."
"Lovely enticing freshness of freshly cut Conference pear jumps from the glass. On the palate, the pear fruit becomes fleshed out with more juiciness and ripeness and shines with its pristine purity. There is a lovely phenolic edge that gives guiding structure alongside lemon freshness. This is concentrated but not heavy, rounded but utterly refreshing. This strikes a great balance between freshness and generosity and has a dry lip-smacking finish."
"A whiff of blossom clings to the appetizing hint of freshly cut red-apple peel on the nose of this very pale ros. The palate adds richness and a touch of honey and chalk that provides a sonorous dimension, filling the mouth with the bounty of ripe, red apples. The mousse is creamy, underlining the ample structure that allows the ripe acidity to swirl alluringly across the palate. This brisk but generous sparkler would work on the table."
"A wine that was fermented in wood before bottling, this is rich, with a definite edge of toast and spice. It is ripe with crisp fruit, although the wood has broadened the wine, giving it an attractive oxidative character. Drink this fine wine now."
"This Chablis-esque bottling from Leo Hansenthe Danish, Healdsburg-based sommelier-turned-winemakeroffers Gravenstein apple, buttered toast and mandarin orange zest aromas. The palate is high-toned and brisk, with zesty citrus peel and grapefruit pith flavors and a prominent chalk-like minerality."
"This ripe wine from the Montagne de Reims is dominated by its 75% Pinot Noir. That gives a rich wine, full of ripe berry and citrus fruits and with a strong edge of tannin and minerality. It is younga vintage that needs to age. Drink this firm, youthful wine from 2019."
"Designer Philippe Starck was involved in the blending and label design of this Champagne. It is a pure crisp white-fruit-flavored wine, almost austere with intense acidity.

"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this boasts apple, bread crust and toasted hazelnut aromas that follow through to the smooth silky palate along with an orange-zest note. Crisp acidity lifts the creamy flavors. Delicious."
"Still young, this rich, lightly honeyed and intensely ripe wine is beautifully structured. It has swathes of apricot, citrus and gooseberry fruits as well as a dense concentrated texture. The wine is certainly in need of aging. Drink from 2019."
"Soft and round, with an undeniable Old World-like balance, this wine shows dark chocolate, tobacco and tar notes. Its power derives from its complex texture, imbued with a smoky oak essence and clove and graphite accents."
"Most Domaine Serene single-vineyard wines are grown right on the Dundee Hills estate; this one reflects a different home, in the Eola Hills AVA. It's a delicious riot of red and blue fruits, with toast, chicory and a touch of licorice threaded through. The balance and muscle are there to keep this in fine shape through at least 2027, but it's delicious right now, so why wait?"
"This is a class act. Fresh white breadcrumb and crisp, ripe red apple combine to create an appetizing nose. The lively fizz on the palate makes the tart but ripe red-apple notions stand out, painted against a mellow, yeasty backdrop and resonant, bready depth. This wine is crisp and rich in equal measure, bold and full flavored, yet elegant and smooth. Outstanding freshness, brightness and purity become apparent on the long finish."
"Though still very young, this bottling is already compelling. Black currant, black plum, fig, rosemary and game aromas arise on the concentrated nose. The layered palate offers fennel, cracked rainbow peppercorn, black currant jam and hoisin sauce flavors, cut by a vibrant acidity that penetrates into the finish."
"A touch of honey clings to appetizingly tart red-apple fruit on the nose. The palate brings in a bright streak of lemon freshness that is both countered and enhanced by the fine, creamy mousse. Elegant litheness and an ease of touch elevate flavors to tart, crisp ripeness. The lip-smacking, pure finish reveals lovely brioche notes. Still taut and fresh, it would make a great apritif. The wine will round out with a little bottle age. Drink 20172025."
"Produced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards in the Cte des Blancs, this is a beautiful, dry wine. It has a chalky texture and ample acidity that frames the tight fruit. The pure line of citrus and crisp green apples goes right to the heart of this balanced, bright wine that will age well. Drink now for the forward fruit, or wait for another two to three years."
This ripe wine is still young. It has a taut texture that's dominated by the lively white fruit and crisp acidity. There's a mineral streak that cuts through the wine to give a steely texture that will soften over the next year. Drink from the end of 2018.
"This barrel-fermented white wine from Jesse Katz of Devil Proof and Aperture Wines is impressively layered and complex. A reductive whiff of petrol leads on the nose yet the palate is juicy, showing a wealth of peach skin and green apple. A bite of acidity supports its fresh, fruity core."
"This lovely blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Grenache is hearty and robust, with lavender, garrigue, black pepper and cinnamon aromas. Its velvety texture gives way to rich blueberry cobbler flavors peppered with firewood smoke notes, recalling a winter's night."
"Precise and polished, this wine offers up a mix of fig, plum, black cherry, chocolate and caramel. A streak of graphite underscores the polished tannins. Good already, this can be cellared and enjoyed through 2028 and perhaps beyond."
"This is a very delicious and accessible wine for all palates, both lavish in style and complex. Candied blackberry, fragrant rose and fennel pollen aromas introduce a palate of baked red fruit, maple syrup and brown sugar flavors. That fruit-forward richness is balanced by extreme floral character and lively acidity."
"This bold, intense expression of the variety entices with an exuberant nose of white pepper, clove and cardamom scents, a spark of pine needle fragrance just underneath. Tingly acidity provides freshness and added succulence to its otherwise rich texture and black cherry decadence."
"With sizable additions of Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc and aged nearly two years in new French oak, this wine has lavender scents and soft, rounded edges. Mountain tannins and fresh acidity frame its chocolate and dark, spicy berry flavors. It finishes on a toasted oak note."
"Dominated by rich Chardonnay, this is a ripe wine. Acidity and a mineral texture are foils to the rich apple and green-plum flavors, giving a balance between deliciously crisp and a fuller style. It is just about ready to drink but will be better from 2018."
"A barrel-selection, top-of-the-line cuve, this is intensely aromatic with black cherry, soft leather and baking spices in play. Flavors focus in the midpalate, leading into supple tannins and a smattering of cocoa powder. Overall it's a big wine, full flavored, balanced and already drinking very well."
"Just two barrels of this Paul Hobbs-consulted wine were made, and that focus is evidenced by its soft and lavish vanilla, mace, cocoa, white pepper and lavender aromas and its core of cassis fruit. Luxurious tannins and underlying acidity carry measured blackberry and chocolate flavors."
"Exotic blueberry and cassis aromas are accented by cardamom and wild-herb scents. This Malbec from Altamira in the Uco Valley is jammy and saturated, but pure, with ripe berry, oak and spice flavors. A juicy fruit-filled finish is packed and tastes like berry compote. Lastly, a delicate herbal note gives this complexity. Drink through 2024."
"Deep and dark in the glass, this bottling from a family-owned winery shows aromas of cola spice, wild cherry, cocoa dust and game. On the palate, rich black-cherry fruit is expertly cut by accents of dried sagebrush and licorice. Persistent, bountiful acidity carries it to a black raspberry-inflected finish."
"A subtle touch of lemon appears first. On the palate, this is amplified with lemony zest and brightness. Wonderfully dry and light, with a singing, illuminating freshness, this enlivens the palate and puts a spring in your step. There is concentration but also a wonderfully light touch. This is dry and utterly invigorating with a bracing, long and vivid finish of pure lemon. Drink 20172030."
"A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027."
"Clean Asian pear, wet gravel and lime peel aromas show on the tightly wound nose of this bottling. The palate is quite delicate at first, offering lightly seared white peach, chalk and lime zest notes, but grows increasingly savory and delicious as it opens, indicating great cellar potential. Drink 20182030."
"Fresh, elegant and well structured, this gorgeous white offers heady aromas of spring wild flower, white stone fruit, citrus and an inviting whiff of toasted nut. It's bright and savory, delivering yellow apple, nectarine drop and almond while a saline note wraps around the lingering finish."
"With its winery close to the Chardonnay heartland of the Cte des Blancs, it is no surprise that this massive cooperative can produce a fine Blanc de Blancs. This vintage iteration is mineral and full of tangy orange zest acidity. It also has a softer element from the dosage that comes through at the end to leave a balanced wine. Drink now."
"This is all Pommard clone Pinot from a vineyard in the McMinnville AVA. It's loaded with ripe, fleshy cherry fruit and suggestions of steely minerality, typical of the terroir. Big, full, delicious and nicely balanced, it wraps up with a yummy chocolaty finish."
"This bottling's core of black cherry fragrance is wrapped in sugar plum, balsamic, allspice and nutmeg notes, combining elegance and power. Mulberry and wild cherry flavors show on the palate, lifted by baking spice and gingerbread accents and balanced by solid acidity and tannins. A sagebrush note pops on the finish."
"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark. It packs bright and fruity raspberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and crushed violet aromas on the nose. The refreshing palate pairs snappy raspberry fruit with fennel pollen and eucalyptus touches."
"This wine's wild raspberry, mace, composting violets, kola nut and musk hints make for a very pretty but extremely complex nose. Fermented with 30% whole clusters, it's energetic on the palate, with dark cranberry and sharp raspberry flavors enhanced by allspice and anise. It has a very long finish."
"A tropical whiff of passion fruit hovers enticingly on the nose. A touch of this also clings aromatically to the taut palate where concentrated citrus notes of orange, lemon and tangerine dominate. This is resolutely dry and bouncingly fresh with precision, fruit and verve. The finish is totally refreshing and lip-smacking."
"This is an impressive wine. From the floral aromas to the crisp mineral-driven texture, the wine is tense, structured and very stylish. The apple, green plum and nervy texture are of a piece with the Chardonnay fruit from some of the finest villages in the Cte des Blancs. Drink this wine now."
"Winemaker Paul Clifton excelled in this vintage, finding the balance between the region's ripe fruit, natural acidity and powerful spice. Baked black cherry, hibiscus, earth, gingerbread and cola notes show on the nose. The palate is creamy and lush, but the acidity is persistent, carrying its dark red fruit and minty chocolate flavors into the finish."
"From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead. The old-vine grapes create a skeleton of mineral and acid upon which just-ripe fruit flavors of mulberry, plum and blueberry are placed. Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer."
"This deeply fruited wine is a rich cranberry/purple in hue, and flavors put blueberry and plum front and center. There's a touch of cassis, and the tannins are brushed velvety smooth, while remaining substantial, even muscular. Bergamot, pomegranate and marionberry flavors come through as well, in a lush cascade of spicy fruits."
"This perfumed and floral wine is concentrated and dense. Its ripe black-plum and spice flavors are impressive with their intensity. Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, the wine is showing considerable aging potential. Drink this wine from 2020."
"Smooth blackberry, chocolate, violet and raisin aromas make for a complete nose. A saturated, ripe palate is a touch heavy, while heady flavors of licorice, black peppercorn and blackberry are slightly charred on a flush finish. Drink through 2022."
"Flinty reduction hovers on the nose before the palate brings lemony freshness to the fore. While stony notes persist, lemon brightness and a fine, creamy mousse make for a superfresh and elegant body. The finish is dry and long. This wine is lovely now but will reward cellaring. Drink 20172022."
"Burnt tea, forest floor and crushed leaf aromas ride atop dense layers of turned earth and stemmy rose scents in this intriguing wine from a beloved site. Moderate acidity keeps it fresh, highlighting its succulent black cherry fruit with lavender and Asian spice notes that emerge on the finish."
"A lick of lemon tanginess plays on the nose alongside a touch of peach. The palate reprises this lemon freshness and lets it dance softly on the fluid, dry palate. Peach and mirabelle can be glimpsed, too. This is dry and fresh, clean and vivid, leaving the palate cleansed and refreshed. The lemon echoes long, joined by zesty grapefruit on the finish, and makes this totally moreish."
"This estate red is named after its mountainous localea brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 20242034."
"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas. A tight boysenberry note emerges on the palate, dusted with clove and lavender and cut by lively acidity. A thorough and complete wine."
"Only produced in magnums, this Champagne is crisp, tight and with intense acidity. It is tangy, salty with lemon and grapefruit flavors. It is only just ready to drink, the magnum allowing it to age more slowly. Best to drink from 2018."
"The wine in this 100% Pinot Noir comes from one of the top villages in the Montagne de Reims. It is rich, structured and with a youthful character despite its nine years . It has berry and rich plum fruits as well as a dry core of acidity. Drink this ageworthy Champagne from 2019."

"A funky smoky notion of yeast clings to the nose on which a pure lemon streak becomes apparent. A generous, luscious and almost creamy sweetness then conquers the palate, boosting all of the fruit flavors, wrapping them in its creamy mellow embrace. The pure lemon streak counters and brightens the richness and around the edges there is grapefruit spice. This is all rather beguiling but not overdone. The finish is moreish, medium sweet and long."
"This vintage delivers a wine with deep and rustic cherry, boysenberry, sweet herb and rose aromas, the latter contributing a penetrating floral dimension. Pure raspberry, potpourri and thyme notes pop on the palate, where clean acidity and tight tannins provide a light frame and carry the flavors toward a caramelized finish."
"This lightly sparkling, terroir-driven wine is loaded with soul and finesse. It's ethereal and bone dry, with delicately alluring aromas and flavors of white spring flower, ripe apple, Bartlett pear, citrus and Alpine herb. Crisp acidity and a silky mousse provide balance and finesse while a mineral note energizes the focused finish. The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass."
"The nose of this bottling is extremely focused on black raspberry and grapeseed, and its snappy dark fruit is tempered with agebrush, lavender and mace aromas. Firm and upright tannins frame the palate, where dark cranberry and clove flavors combine for layers of energy and depth."
"This is a dry-style Riesling, though it still lends a ripe, fruity impression. Lemon, lime and grapefruit are shuffled into a winning hand, with ample details of cilantro, fennel and wet stone. It's a vibrant, refreshing wine that is immensely food friendly."
"Finely chopped herb notes, recalling marjoram, thyme and anise, combine with with dried rose and red cherry aromas on the delicately wild nose of this bottling. The palate adds forest floor flavors to its dark red fruit, making for a heady expression that grows in complexity sip after sip."

"Once again, this more affordable younger brother to the Mount Eden bottling competes with gusto. Including 14% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, it shows savory black plum, black pepper, char, leather and dried herb aromas on the nose. The palate is hearty and almost salty tasting, with beef, charred black fruit, pine resin and caramel flavors. Very satisfying and full of umami characteristics."
"A rich floral notion of dandelion precedes the rich aroma of ripe peaches on the nose. The palate opens into a kind of vast peach mellowness, edged with a touch of citrus zest and a grounding, earthy element. A gentle sweetness boosts the peachy roundedness but does not dominate. This is gentle on the surface but very concentrated at the core. It is on the off-dry finish that the lemon zest comes though triumphantly. Drink 20172027."
"Lovely structure amplifies all the best qualities of this estate-grown wine. A tight core of pear, lemon and tangerine fruit sets up a long finish. The acidity is clean and in perfect proportion, with no chalkiness. Drink now through 2027."
"From one of the top of the new generation of Vouvray estates, this wine is a delicious medley of fruit flavors. With a touch of honey to go with the apple, and citrus to give extra freshness, this is a beautiful wine. It is very drinkable although still so young. Drink now if you can't wait, but it's better to hold on until 2021."
"A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges. While this is attractive now, it will reward cellaring as far more interesting notes of spice and fruit are sure to develop. Drink 20202030."
"Ripe berry aromas are touched up with cola and root-beer notes that make this even nicer. A muscular, deeply structured palate is home to herbal plum and berry flavors along with notes of coffee and dark spices. Tobacco and herbal notes take over on a complex finish. Drink this Cabernet Franc (with 15% Malbec) through 2024."
"This wine comes from a parcel that is planted at a superhigh density of nearly 7,000 plants per acre. This gives the plants greater competition between each other and encourages concentration of the wine. That is true in this rich wine with its impeccable balance between white fruit and mineral texture from the chalk soil. The wine will age, so drink from 2020."
"Made exclusively from Pinot Noir, this is a rich and highly textured wine. Red fruit aromas yield a ripe impression on the palate, while at the same time, it is dry and crisp in tangy acidity, with a zesty lemon flourish. This food-friendly wine is ready to drink."

"Here's a smooth, delicious Prosecco that will satisfy both the novice and the sophisticated wine lover. It opens with lovely aromas of pressed wild flower, apple and a whiff of pastry dough that follow through to the palate along with pear, tangerine zest and a hint of almond. An elegant mousse and crisp acidity offset the creamy flavors. It has lingering bone-dry finish."
"This top-tier bottling from Steve Martell, which blends 62% Grenache with 29% Syrah, 5% Mourvdre and 4% Petite Sirah, offers roasted coffee, charred black currant, burnt wood and baked earth aromas. The palate is tight and bright with flashy boysenberry and black raspberry flavors balanced by anise and sagebrush accents."
"This wine is predominately Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux red varieties. Together, they offer bold, ripe red-currant and -berry flavors, with a rich entry and gravelly texture. Highly stylized, grippy tannins and a leather note provide additional strength."
"Notions of tart redcurrant play on the nose while a delicious edge of white pepper draws you in. The same pepper entices on the palate, framing fresh, tart berry and lemon purity on the slender but memorable palate. A firm structure makes this spicy, energetic and invigorating little number irresistible. The fine mousse has verve and elegance. It finishes pure and long."
"The nose of this bottling from the former Addamo Vineyard is full of underbrush and sage notes, with complex layers of candied raspberry, wisteria and cinnamon stick aromas. Juicy raspberry and pomegranate flavors kick off the palate, where allspice, nutmeg, dried ginger and flowering thyme notes coalesce."
"With some age, this bone-dry wine has softened and filled out. There's still a lemon aroma as well as crisp acidity on the palate, but they are less tight now, rounded and with a fine balance between fruit and acidity. It is still a year off maturity, so wait until 2018."
"Beautiful, bright boysenberry and blackberry aromas meet fennel and pepper scents on the nose of this blend of 64% Grenache and 36% Syrah, which is sold primarily through the winery's Santa Clarita Valley tasting room. A lavish tannic profile decorates the lush palate, where black currant jam, licorice and clove flavors fight for attention."
"Citrus, apple, crushed herb and wild flower aromas take center stage on this elegant sparkler. It's bright and silky, with savory Bartlett pear, nectarine zest and hints of thyme balanced by a creamy mousse and vibrant acidity. Thanks to its depth of flavors, finesse and crisp dry finish, it beautifully demonstrates Prosecco's serious side."
"Delicately sparkling, this creamy Champagne is crisp, fruity and on the dry side of Brut. It has citrus as well as pear flavors giving a fruity edge to the lively texture. This delicious wine should age a little longer, so drink from 2019."
"A wonderfully aromatic nose of blossom and Conference pear is very appetizing. The palate comes in with pear-fruited generosity and an almost oily mouthfeel that speaks of the power of this concentrated wine. There is a pleasant edge of pithy bitterness that acts as a counterpoint to the inherent richness and ripeness of the fruit alongside fresh acidity. This is balanced and rounded and just off dry with a lovely, fresh structure that echoes long. There is great aging potential here. Drink 20172030."
"A blend of equal Chardonnay and Pinot Noir exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards. It is a rich wine, tightly textured with citrus and tangy acidity. There is a tense core of crispness, with intense fruit and a dry aftertaste. This is a fine bottling that should age further, so drink from 2018."
"The hallmark of Angela Soleno's wines is a sweet, spicy and earthy tobacco note, and this blend of 33% Merlot, 33% Petit Verdot and 33% Sangiovese offers it in droves. Combine that with rich black plum, fresh-picked lilac and rose scents, cinnamon and red currant flavors and soft, creamy tannins, and it's a stunning wine."
"This smooth, velvety powerhouse is a rich, rewarding mix of dark chocolate and raspberry compote flavors, with integrated oak. With its succulent, full-bodied layers of ripe fruit, it pleases the palate in lavish luxury."
"The nose already promises both texture and ripeness with its combined aroma of russet pear peel and juicy pear flesh. The palate only adds to the juicy richness with a good dollop of residual sweetness, boosting all of the pear fruit. This is countered by wonderful lemon drop freshness. The plump but shapely palate is utterly concentrated and aromas of candle wax and honeycomb show that this has just begun to evolve. While the finish has distinct sweetness, it is balanced by 2010's glorious freshness. Lovely now, especially alongside cheese or hot Asian spice, but sure to develop further. Drink 20172030."
Ripe pear is bathed in honey on the nose and palate of this wine. There is a touch of pleasant bitterness reminiscent of fir honey. All this is countered by lemon zest freshness that brightens and lightens and brings beautiful balance and poise. The finish is moreish and refreshing. Drink 20172030.
"These biodynamic grapes, fermented with native yeasts, spent three months in 40% new French oak. It's built like a precision watch, ticking off complete and balanced varietal flavors of citrus rind and juice, with light touches of fresh herb, lemon verbena and a delicate hint of vanilla."
"From one of the most famous vineyard slopes in Sancerre, the wine is tight, structured and still young. It has great potential with rich citrus, herbs and green fruit flavors. Along with the tense, mineral texture, the wine has both concentration and aging ability. Drink from 2019."
"There is something sonorous but restrained about the pure ripe pear notes on the nose of this wine. The palate falls into step: Lovely, pure and resonant pear fruit gently fills nose, mouth and mind. The finish is medium sweet and sustaineda very grown up wine that treads a very fine line between Pinot Gris' inherent generosity and freshness. Totally moreish. Drink 20172030."
"This classic-style wine has cedar, tobacco and dark fruit aromas, bold and ripe flavors and a structure that's very firm yet not harsh. Cinnamon, clove and allspice accents complement its black cherry and dark chocolate notes, while a thick blanket of tannin wraps it all up."
"The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 20192030."
"The latest vintage release from this producer based in Chlons-en-Champagne is very much in the house style with its crisp acidity and tight texture. It is towards the dry end of Brut with apple and citrus flavors and little sign yet of aging. Although this textured wine is ready to drink, it will be better from 2018."
"A shy nose with a hint of citrus leads onto a palate with equally restrained flavors. This wine is all about texture and dryness. The superfine mousse is exquisitely creamy, playing off ripe lemon freshness against a softly autolytic background suggesting oatmeal with hints of white pepper. This is unshowy but conveys understated elegance. It finishes beautifully dry and fresh."
"Impressively dark and dense in the glass, this bottling from Edgar Torres from a coastal site offers pungent black currant, leather, wet asphalt and black pepper aromas. The palate's charred black plum flavors are wrapped in serious tannins and bolstered by bright acidity. This will evolve into a stellar wine with patience. Drink 20202034."
"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day."
"With almost five years of aging on its lees, this is now a rich mature wine. It has a toasty, spicy character to balance the still-vibrant white-fruit flavors. The acidity is a foil to the richness of the wine, cutting through and giving a crisp, always mature aftertaste."
"This impressive wine comes from the northernmost of the Grand Cru villages of the Cte des Blancs, where the chalk soil contains more clay. This gives a wine with weight and fine fruitiness. The hints of toast are just showing through the citrus fruits indicating that the wine is just ready to drink."
"This is a fabulous example of a light, balanced wine from the Santa Lucia Highlands, which is perhaps better known for richness. It shows savory aromas of smoked cherries, nose-tickling sage, juniper-laced sausage and cayenne pepper. The palate is energetic, with a pleasant viscosity that carries its cranberry, cherry, thyme, oregano and sandalwood flavors into the finish."
"Delicate, compelling aromas of ripe pear, lily of the valley and pressed acacia flower mingle with a whiff of aromatic herbs. The smooth, silky palate delivers yellow apple and white peach alongside a creamy mousse and fresh acidity. A lovely sparker of pedigree and finesse."
"It is lemon that constitutes the beginning, middle and end of this alluring wine. The first bright freshness flashes on the nose. The absolutely dry palate then becomes enveloped in the incisive, bright and invigorating fruit and zest of ripe lemon, providing direction and litheness. The finish is moreish and lip-smacking with the zesty freshness. You simply want more. Drink 20172027."
"The scent of fresh fragrant orange peel has a totally honeyed edge on the nose. The palate, however, has a wonderfully clear and clean-cut green pear and lemon note that simply sings. There is concentration and poise but also a feeling that this might be far better with a few years of cellar age. The beautifully dry palate is concentrated and has impact but is not heavy; the finish is lip-smacking and vivid. It's lovely now but better later. Drink 20172030."
"This is a juicy, succulent and high-toned wine aged in both stainless steel and French oak. From a site rich in volcanic soils, it exudes a flinty, stony element that's incredibly compelling, accented with passionfruit and grapefruit flavors and driven by lengthy acidity."
"Freshly cut peel of tart but ripe red apple entices on the nose. The palate embraces all this with the subtle, creamy richness of autolysis: Think shortcake and soft sponge. A luminous core of fresh, brisk acidity brightens everything, lifting up flavors of red apple, strawberry and tart red currant on the palate. This harmonious ros leaves a lasting impression and is appetizing with its lightning streak of freshness."
"This wine is beautifully floral, with a honeyed touch of apple blossom on the nose. Stony mineral and sea breeze accents add to its complexity, as seductive, smooth layers of creme brle and preserved lemon flavor provide oomph and grace."
"A strong chaparral spice note marks the nose of this bottling, with background aromas of roast pork, sage, blueberry syrup and Dr. Pepper. Framed by firm but forgiving tannins, the palate offers cracked pepper, blackened lamb, pine forest and rosemary flavors."
"The nose of this bottling from winemaker Tyler Thomas is simultaneously delicate and voluptuous, with strawberry, plump plum, crushed slate and pepper seasonings. The palate is focused, with fresh red fruit, a rocky structure and strong thyme, marjoram and sage characteristics. Soft and delicious, it finishes with a dried strawberry kick."
"Equal parts earth and fruit, this full-bodied Riesling offers loads of penetrating melon, citrus and honey flavors offset by delicate tones of saffron and dusty mineral. Dry in style and struck by exhilarating acidity, it offers exceptional balance and complexity."
"Juicy, penetrating raspberry fruit launches this tight young wine into the center of the palate. The overall balance and prominent acidity suggests that it is a good cellar candidate. Drink 2020 to 2030, and aerate aggressively if you plan to pop it in the near term."
"Gutsy and full-bodied, this small-production wine offers more structure than usual, its bright acidity and ripe tannins in full support of the tasty red and black cherry flavors. With earth, beef and oak nuances, it will taste great with hearty proteins, especially after some cellaring. Best after 2020."
"Hints of tart redcurrant have a softenting creamy edge. The palate fizzes with tiny bubbles that disperse the red-fruited, creamy tartness across the palate. A lovely touch of white pepper and enduring, beautiful briskness brightens everything from the first sip to the last echo of flavor on the lip-smacking finish. It's fresh, mouthfilling and exuberant."
"There is a savory touch of salt and herb amidst the fruity mirabelle plum notes on the nose. The palate shows a lovely background of autolytic richness, akin to sponge and rye bread and also has a piquant salty accent that entices all the way to the lemony bright finish. The mousse is fine and elegant, the finish is long and dry."
"Lush aromatics push a bouquet of toasted hazelnuts, citrus peel, apples and white peaches up from the glass. Flavors follow in a clean, spicy wine with a fresh and lively mouthfeel. One-third of the fruit was sourced from the estate's premier Jacob-Hart vineyard, and the wine spent 11 months in 20% new French oak."
"This wine brims with fruit and freshness. A host of apple notions comes alive on nose and palate: The appetizing, ripe tartness of Cox Orange Pippin, the mouthwatering crispness of Granny Smith and the mellowness of Golden Delicous. It has a refreshing, open honesty, juicy and totally inviting. Underneath all that allure lies rich autolysis, underlined by a fine, creamy mousse. Flavors and freshness linger."
"Earthy notes of sweet beets and mushroom mingle amidst violet and lavender in this beautifully fragrant, complex wine. It's brisk and fresh with acidity yet penetrating in black cherry and currant flavors. Dense, deeply penetrating tannins frame a long, bold finish."
"This wine shows a touch of spicy, smoky oak from aging in 20% new French barrels, setting off powerful fruity, earthy flavors that create a complex, layered and fascinating personality. It's full bodied, mouth-filling and moderately tannic."
"This subtle, restrained and elegant wine from a classic producer leads with nice doughy, toasty aromas. It fills the mouth with delicate bubbles and lingers on the finish, giving more toasty complexity and lasting fruit impressions."
"A gravelly texture lends complexity to this well-made celebration of the appellation. Sea salt meets lemon and green apple flavors, building toward more robust fig and pear characteristics. It's a beautiful wine, with a balanced approach to concentration and weight."
"As befits a producer whose vines are on the Montagne de Reims, this blend is dominated by Pinot Noir. This vintage is tangy with a toasty nutty character while still retaining plenty of youthful fruit. It is dry, textured and likely to be at its best from 2019."
"Citrus foliage and zest hover aromatically on the nose before being subsumed into a richer, generous but always brisk palate. This wine offers both bold, crisp, invigorating green apple sharpness and a gentler notion of lemon shortbread. It's bright and pure, with a creamy, exuberant sparkle that conveys lemony freshness. That pure, lemony, superclean finish resonates and makes you want to sip more. This would be a mouth-watering apritif."
"Touches of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot contribute to this wine's overall complexity. The cuve formerly known as Cask, it now emphasizes the historic estate property. Red currant and cedar notes and firm tannins strike first, as bright, underlying acidity provides balance. Tobacco leaf and chocolate flavors mark the long finish."
"Based in the Chardonnay region of the Cte des Blancs, it's no surprise that this producer has a dominance of that grape in its blend. The wine has great minerality as well as tight acidity and delicious citrus flavors. It's a dry, finely balanced wine to drink now."
"This is a very supple wine from a vineyard just north of Highway 246, with baked strawberry, iron, cinnamon and allspice aromas, recalling French toast on the nose. The palate is tarter, with cranberry, rose petal, fennel frond and vanilla flavors that carry deep into the finish."
"The mix of fresh crisp apple and shortbread notes on the nose is a delight. The same interplay of fresh, ripe and crisp apple fruit and the more developed richer notes of autolysis continue on the light and dry palate, supported by lively fine fizzing mousse. Inherent freshness brightens the entire palate while the long shortbread-tinged aftertaste makes for a very elegant finish. Lovely."
"Compact, almost gritty aromas of tree bark and herbal berry fruits require time to breathe. After necessary airing, this is elegant and fresh on the palate, but full in body. Herbal plum and berry flavors are leathery, spicy and suggest tomato as this transitions to a firm, racy finish. Drink through 2020."
"Sourced from the Durant vineyard in the Dundee Hills, this is barrel fermented in neutral oak using native yeast. It's complex and textural, with layers of ripe tree fruits. Peaches and mixed tropical fruits are in play, along with some baking-spice highlights. It's full-bodied and irresistible, diving deeply into a lush finish. Drink now through 2022."
"Rich red cherry, rust, smoke and crushed gravel aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Smoked meat, lavender and rose petal notes play with cranberry, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors, creating a pleasant mix of delicate and savory elements."
"A touch of dried citrus peel on the nose suggests slight development. The palate adds judicious weight and backbone in the form of very fine creamy mousse and a lovely structure that holds mellow apple fruit and bright citrus. The finish is dry, fresh but mellow. Both autolysis and lemon freshness become apparent on the long aftertaste. It's a sophisticated, refreshing but rounded winter time apritif."
"Owner Molly Chappellet's beloved baby, this white is deliciously crisp, dry and balanced, with layers of Meyer lemon, waxy apple and floral gardenia. Percolating acidity maintains its freshness beneath its rich texture and tropical succulence."
"A limited bottling, this single-clone, single-vineyard wine is precise, sculpted and tightly wound. A steely firmness runs straight down the core, with apple, green herbs, citrus rind and tangerine flavors strung along for the ride. It's easily worth cellaring for another six to eight years. Drink now through 2024."
"Ripe, full, smooth and rich, this deftly expresses the black-cherry fruit that typifies this exceptional AVA. As with the entire Lavinea lineup, this wine captures a diverse and complex range of fruits within its core flavors. It also has an iron spine, a vein of licorice, and a whiff of rosemary."
"Red apple and brioche aromas are tinged with lemon. The palate has the same fruit, richness and freshness, but expresses this with lightness and ease. It's a versatile sparkler, ideal for both apritif and dinner. The finish is dry, balanced and elegant."
"Juicy peach and aromatic orange make for an appetizing fruit-driven opening. The palate adds an element of pure zestiness and bright freshness to these exuberant, ripe and enticing fruit notes. This masters this playful tension between fruit and freshness beautifully. There is a touch of heat on the just-about-dry finish, but this spells fun, full fruit and total refreshment. Drink 20172025."
"A rich, mellow whiff of vanilla and burnt sugar sweeps across the nose at first before appetizing tart notes of Granny Smith apple kick in. The palate is superfresh with these same green apple notes but also has a toasty mellowness adding and earthy charm and a richer, pithy texture. The finish is rounded but dry and lasting."
"White peach aromas and powerful fruitiness give this wine great intensity. It is bone dry while rich, full of quince, pear and peach fruits. There is an extra richness from the edge of wood aging. The wine is still young and should not be drunk before 2020."
"Hay flowers and juicy yellow pear create an enticing nose and promise rich ripeness. The palate brims with wonderfully ripe pear fruit, countered by citric freshness that brightens and heightens the flavors. The mouthfeel is rich but defined. It is the wonderful streak of freshness that holds all of this rich fruitiness together. The finish is dry and refreshing."
"This wine is powerful and concentrated but sophisticated, too. It offers a medley of ripe fruit, dark spice, mouthfilling texture and age-worthy structure. The color is inky-dark and the aromas cassis-laden, with baking spice and a light smoky accent. The flavors recall dark chocolate and macerated cherries. Best after 2022."
"Quite light in color, this wine has a ton to like, starting with its thyme, oregano, juniper and tart cranberry aromas. The palate is overloaded with energy, showing snappy raspberry, kalamata olive and iron-rich mineral notes. A great example of fresh Pinot Noir."
"From a Green Valley vineyard high on a ridge, this is an exceptional and softly layered wine, with cola, plum and black cherry notes. Offering length and breadth with moderate acidity and oak, it's dark and brooding in all the best ways."
"Gorges is one of the recently created village crus or village appellations in Muscadet. The wine has richness and a dense character not always found in Muscadets. While it has some age, which has softened the intense fruit, it is still crisp, fruity and ripe with apple, lime and spice. Drink now."
"A full blast of very ripe peach hits the nose. The palate adds a touch of lemony freshness and a sweet rose perfume to this, creating an off-dry, floral and fruity swirl across the palate. There is something gentle about this, something charming and friendly. The lemony freshness keeps everything on the bright vivid side. The finish is lasting and off dry."
"This small production blend of 90% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon Blanc leads with fragrant, inviting floral qualities and well-defined layers of peach and apricot fruit. Light and bright, it's balanced, focused and utterly delicious."
"In its gold bottle signed by designer Adriana Karembeu, this bottling delivers bling as well as wine. The wine inside justifies the hypea delicious apple flavor dominating along with acidity. The brand is getting drier each year with a crisp style that has a mineral edge as well as tangy orange flavors. Drink this attractive Champagne now."
"This attractive young, fruity wine is crisp, tangy and with delicious freshness. Its floral aroma and ripe pear and melon fruitiness give it a fine rich balance. With a delicious bright aftertaste the wine is ready to drink."
"Enticing scents of white flowers and citrus blossom lead the nose of this elegant wine. Silky and crisp, the bright palate delivers yellow apple, pear and a tangy hint of tangerine, framed in vibrant acidity and a polished perlage."
"This big but complex wine offers wonderful varietal characteristics. Sage and blackberry highlight the aromas, while equally interesting black pepper, beef and blackberry flavors expand on the palate. It has very good depth and a distinctive flavor profile, too."
"Apple skin, sea stone and lemon notes comprise the light-bodied narrative of this balanced, bright and complex wine. From a vintage known for its modest yields, this wine shows the quality of the producer's estate vineyards, which range across the appellation."
"This bottling smells much like a bundle of freshly cleared sagebrush, with hints of fennel, charred tomato, wood, cola and wild black cherry. Its extremely soft mouthfeel massages the tongue with lush tannins, and its black cherry richness is cut by tart pomegranate-like acidity and lifted by cocoa, coffee and ginger spice notes."
"Lightly smoky and spicy oak nuances top off this deeply fruity and concentrated wine, which has firm tannins and good acidity to support its richness. Almost-sweet plum and black cherry notes form its core, while vanilla and baking spice notes complete the picture."
"This broad-shouldered, full-bodied wine shocks and awes with its clove and black pepper notes that are as savory as a fine steak, with which it would pair brilliantly. Oak and tannin form a shield of power that girds the black fruit for further battle."
"There is an earthy touch to the almost overripe peach notes on the nose. The palate adds both sweetness and a subtle welcome hint of phenolic bitterness to the peachy fruit. Bright lemon freshness cuts through the medium-sweet palate to provide a fresh, almost lip-smacking finish. This wine is full of ripe expressive fruit flavors, giving equal billing to lemon and peach."
A funky glint of smoke and yeast precedes rich notions of mirabelle and peach compote. The palate enforces this notion of rich sweet compote even more and adds a welcome lemony vein of freshness to it. There is great balance here between juicy ripe sweetish fruit and tangy uplifting freshness. The finish is off dry and generously fruited.
"Winemaker Isabelle Meunier (ex-Evening Land) has carefully selected a handful of sites for her first release of single-vineyard wines under this new label. This is perhaps the most elegant, with exceptional texture, color and overall finesse. Fruits are delicate and detailed, showing watermelon, salmonberry, strawberry and a bit of spice. The 30% new French oak aging adds a gentle kiss of cocoa. Drink now to 2030 and beyond."
"Danish sommelier-turned-winemaker Leo Hansen aims to make food-friendly wines, and this delicate Chenin is a great example. Light honey, candied lemon, lime pith and tangerine peel aromas show subtly on the nose. Sparkly acidity makes its clean and crisp nectarine, cherimoya and lime skin flavors pop, with pinpoint focus and a slight grip."
"Blended with 8% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, this is a well-made wine from the mountain appellation. With integrated oak and a supportive undercurrent of acidity, it's rounded and rich in bright cherry fruit, the accents a mix of clove and graphite, finishing with balance."
"This small producer devoted to the variety continues to impress with this vintage, crafting here a balanced beauty, with vibrant white pepper, garrigue and herbes de Provence aromas. Pungently earthy, it offers a voluptuous texture yet relatively light body, meaty flavor and finesse."
"Ripe, earthy aromas of baked berry fruits, cassis and licorice lead to a chewy, stout palate. Oaky flavors of ripe blackberry and cassis are rooty and leathery, while this tastes of chocolate and fig on a broad finish. Drink through 2023."
"Smoked strawberry and concentrated red plum aromas meet hickory smoke, fresh herb and rose petal scents in this great bottling. The zingy palate is fresh, lively and quite complex, from its oregano, thyme and tarragon notes to its core of pomegranate and dark raspberry fruit to its savory, leathery finish."
"This producer's light take on the variety continues to impress with this vintage. Anise and oak hints combine on the nose to invite one in for an elegant taste of bright, juicy acidity and refined lemon and green apple flavors."
"The name Septette references seven blocks planted to seven clones in the estate vineyard. The fruit flavors mix red berries and purple plums, with some tangy tropical details. It's big, plush, delicious and finished unfined and unfiltered."
"While this wine is certainly sweet with yellow fruits and plenty of ripe honey flavors, it also has a beautiful streak of acidity that allows the wine to be crisply textured. There are spice, great fruitiness and a bright tight aftertaste. Drink now, or better from 2020."
"Roasted, gamy aromas are slightly cool, reedy and herbal. This wine is jammy and deep on the palate, with black-fruit flavors aided by gamy notes, spice and exotic herbs. A deep finish with bold acidity solidifies the wine's excellence. Drink through 2024; contains 15% Malbec."
"Tautly structured and lightly refreshing, this wine is an outstanding expression of high-toned stone fruit, lime and salt. The texture is seamless and round, with a lasting streak of juicy acidity."
"This atypical blend brings exceptional fruit to the table, with Pinot Noir sourced from the Dundee Hills and Syrah from Walla Walla. Syrah dominates the aromas, with gamy whiffs of smoke, coffee and and licorice. The tangy black-cherry fruit comes with a streak of balsamic and a hint of pine sap. Though Pinot Noir rarely succeeds with other grapes in the blend, this is the exception that proves the rule."
"Heady aromas of white spring flower and mature apple carry through to the creamy palate along with ripe pear and citrus notes. It's balanced, with vibrant acidity and an elegant perlage that lead into the dry, refreshing finish."
"This big wine has everything required of the variety and more. It starts with vivid citrus, herb and melon aromas, then lays on ripe white peach, honeydew and mineral notes that fill out the palate and lend mouthfilling texture. Layering, complexity and diverse flavors make it special."
"A touch of pepper accentuates the fresh notion of wet stone and citrus on the nose. The palate is bone dry and has a fresh fizzing mousse that accentuates, stone, pepper and green citrus even more. The slightly austere, bone-dry style will come into its own with other pure restrained flavorsthink subtle Japanese dishes. The finish is brisk and superclean."
"This gorgeous white opens with scents suggesting white flower, orchard fruit, lemon pastry and a whiff of wet stone. The creamy palate delivers yellow apple, lemon zest, bitter almond and a savory mineral note. It's supremely elegant and surprisingly fresh for the vintage."
"This wine's intense berry aromas are followed by equally deep flavors, as its meaty, earthy, spicy nuances develop with each sip. It has complexity, concentration, a very smooth texture and that certain wild element that's attractive in Syrah."
"This barrel selection is loaded with tart cherry and blackberry fruit. Scents and accents bring hints of bread, butter, vanilla and coffee. The finish is lengthy and detailed, with no fall off in complexity. It was aged 18 months in roughly half new French oak."
"This full-bodied and firmly tannic wine from a star winery in Lake County has wood smoke and anise aromas, generous black fruit flavors and a good, grippy texture. That structure will help the wine age well, allowing the rather intense flavors to mellow and evolve. Best after 2021."
"Delicate in flavor and firm in texture, this wine is savory and complex, with a slightly lean but very appetizing mouthfeel. Cranberry and black tea aromas are followed by tangy red cherry and cinnamon spice flavors supported by a light layer of fine-grained tannins."
"This beautiful apricot and melon-flavored wine is still so fruity. It shows no sign of its seven years' aging, still keeping a fresh crisp character. There is just this extra depth and richness that brings in almond, spice and a touch of toastiness. Drink this very fine wine now."
"Lemon plays on the nose alongside hints of shortbread. The palate has a lovely rich creaminess and very fine elegant mousse, creating an impression of light-bodied richness. This is sophisticated and dry, elegant and creamyvery grown-up and utterly delicious."
"A yeasty funk still clouds the nose and barely lets the fresh lemon notes through. The palate, however, revels bright lemon and a fine veil of leesy yeast. Right now, this is still taut and very young but its brightness is promising, as is its dry lip-smacking finish. Drink 20172027."
"Vibrant and loaded with finesse, this delicious linear white boasts alluring scents of white wild flower, citrus and apple. The fresh medium-bodied palate delivers nectarine, lemon drop, pear and a hint of ginger. A savory mineral note reminiscent of saline energizes the lingering finish."
"Creamy autolytic notes of rye bread mix with the fruity appeal of tart red berries on the nose. The palate also strikes an expert balance between development and utter freshness. There is tart apple, vivid citrus, and creamy berry, all accentuated by superfine mousse. This is pale, elegant, long, sophisticated and simply lovely."
"At first austere, even severe in its tight, herbal focus, this wine nonetheless intrigues. The unique aromatics deftly touch on fennel, bitter herbs and wet rock. Tart cranberry and pomegranate fruits lurk below, and the wine takes a full 24 hours to open up, adding broader flavors suggesting craisins."
"This estate-grown Riesling is bursting with juicy flavors of Meyer lemon and pink grapefruit. Tangy acids keep it fresh and lively throughout a long finish. It's simply delicious now, and fine for drinking through 2027."
"A turbid brownish-gold color is cloudy but nothing else about this amontillado is unclear. Concentrated aromas of nut oil, pecan pie, molasses and sweat are rugged and raw. Blasting acidity creates pinch on the palate, while this tastes salty and like almonds, pecan pie and white pepper. A long finish with bracing acidity will not be swayed."
A tender subdued nose gives hints of honeysuckle and ripe mirabelles. The medium-sweet palate lets the stone fruit speak even louder but a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides a frame for the juicy sweetness. This is rich and generous and has a lovely tang of tangerine on the warm finish.
"The nose is shy but suggests a little development. The palate is fresh and has developed autolytic notes of bread and brioche with a touch of lemon and ripe apple. This is rounded, harmonious and grown-up with rather fine fizz and a restrained dosage. Lovely as apritif but serious enough to with subtle food. Lovely, clean, balanced and lasting."
"The low-yielding vines average 35 years of age, and their flavors are subtle yet distinctive. This wine unfolds slowly and almost imperceptibly, with subtle minerality around flavors of citrus pith and rind. It's tart and racy, with a lick of Key lime through the finish."
"Cave Spring rocks Riesling, and this off-dry (16g/L) version is sexy and mineral-drenched. It's a perfect mix of sweet and tangy, the citrus and tree fruits dense with complex phenolic highlights that add to a wine that's textural, full bodied and long."
"With just over a half-ton harvested per acre due to the drought, this is a potent wine, with nose-tickling dark boysenberry, asphalt and wet stone aromas and brighter lifts of dried sage and raspberry. The soft palate combines vibrant acidity with raspberry and mulberry flavors and a hint of dried herbs."
"The beautiful apple aromas lead to a delicious wine. It has honey, creamed apple and spice flavors, cut through with acidity as well as almonds. The wine is ripe, balancing its crisp texture with richer fruits. Drink this wine now."
"Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert."
"Dusty and tannic, this is a solid value for its qualitya wine of freshness and grip that offers complexity and approachability in equal measure. Black-cherry and black -pepper flavors highlight the palate."
"As part of a range of wines that are based on specific parcels of vines, this wine has also been partially wood fermented. Its richness and the touches of spice and toastiness give the wine a ripe rounded character. However, it is dry, crisply textured with a touch of tannin to give it structure. Drink now."
"A touch of ripe yellow apple plays on the nose and carries appetizingly onto the palate. The body is light, adding a lemony streak of freshness to the apple fruit while creamy fizz disperses these flavors across the wine. Subtle autolytic notes suggest lemony sponge cake. It finishes dry."
"This blend of 48% Grenache Blanc, 14% Roussanne, 14% Viognier, 12% Marsanne and 12% Vermentino is one of the best and zippiest white Rhne-inspired blends on the market right now. Its clean nose offers key lime, grapefruit pith and gunpowder tea aromas. The palate is grippy and fresh, with zesty lime skin and the slight bubblegum flavors."
"This biodynamic blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from Bendigo draws you in with attractive notes of ripe red apple, pressed yellow flowers, butter, and copper penny. It hooks you on the palate with a chalky texture, tingly acidity, and long, lingering finish. Complex and food friendly yet ultra drinkable."
"Deep black plum and black cherry flavors lend fruit concentration to this full-bodied and mouth-filling wine from a tiny hilltop appellation in Mendocino County. Its dark fruit flavors are quite ripe but not sweet, and a good wrapping of fine-grained tannins supports the richness very well."
"Nutty mature aromas hint at the ripe, certainly mature flavors in the glass. This amazing wine is still intensely rich, still hinting at its past glories of honeyed fruits. But now it is settling comfortably into old agea wine that is almost dry while still rich. Drink now."
"Smooth hints of apricot and vanilla immediately give the nose an impression of richness and generosity. The palate also has a creaminess and sonorous layers of gentle apple and stone fruit, mingling with notions of sponge cake. But this stays on the svelte side, brightened by a lightning flash of brisk crispness. It combines freshness and mellowness, showing what reserve wines can do to a delicious blend. The finish is dry, pure and delicious."
"This rich, mouth-filling wine starts with almost-sweet floral, plummy, oaky aromas, building toward ripe cherry, strawberry and black plum flavors and a smooth texture. Everything, from its deep color to its lingering finish, suggests a bold personality."
"A kind of zesty ripeness rises from the glass, uniting ripe tangerine and orange peel with a lovely notion of peach. There also is a lifted touch of honey. The medium-sweet palate gives these flavors full rein. Fleshy ripe fruit is bathed in honeyed while zestiness provides a counterpoint. This one is wonderfully rich, rounded and aromatic with long-lasting flavors."
"Aged in wood and certainly dry, this creamed apple wine is ripe, hinting at toast from wood aging and with a fine mineral texture. Finely balanced, it is rich while still poised, cut with acidity and lime-juice flavor. Drink now for the fruitiness or wait until 2020."
"If the term mellow were to be made into a liquid this would be it. Both nose and palate have the sonorous gentle richness of very ripe pear, with the richness of some dried pear fruit, too. This late-harvest style has sweet richness but is also utterly balanced. There is enough freshness and structure to corral the fruit into something easy, gentle, generous and warming. This is so unobtrusive, so balanced that it might disappear very quickly."
"Very vivid notes of green citrus signal refreshment and lightness. The palate confirms this near weightless lightness and underlines it with fine tiny bubbles that fizz away creamily, providing a counterpoint and resulting in a wine that is both exquisitely light, dry, creamy and elegant. If you are looking for a sophisticated but light apritif, this is your answer."
"A subdued nose opens up into a citrus palate that has unusual licorice overtones, with smoky intrigue. The body is precise and bone dry, letting lemon and licorice shine and allowing the citrus freshness to brighten and heighten everything. The finish is superclean. Drink this now through 2025."
"Naturally sparkling rather than needing any addition of yeast or sugar, this fine bone-dry wine has great style, great character. Its honey, apple and slight oxidative flavor are all part of a wine that is impressively ripe and ready to drink."
"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 20172022."
"This producer's signature grape is Chardonnay and this Champagne with its tight, nervy and mineral character is a fitting emblem. It is crisp, with green-apple fruit and lively acidity. Underneath there is a structure that will allow the bottling to age further. Drink from 2018."
"Concentrated and rich in flavor and creamy in texture, this wine has a big profile without seeming overtly fruity or oaky. The mouthfeel is lush, broad and quietly powerful, while subtle pear and marzipan flavors coat the palate and linger on the finish. It makes a grand impression and is meaty enough to serve with poultry or even beef. Winemaker Tracy Hart used no oak or stainless steel, fermenting and aging the wine in food-grade polyethylene FlexTanks."
"Wonderfully pure and mellow Red Delicious notes are displayed on the nose, promising pleasure. The palate has an even stronger impression of this vivid fruit as well as a superfine, tender and creamy mousse that counteracts the inherent freshness. This is dry and elegant and brimming with pure apple flavors. The finish is mouth-watering and utterly moreish with its clean long echo of red apple."
"Ripe mirabelle fruit plays on the nose and leads onto a very rich, creamy but fresh palate. This is autolytic generosity set against bright lemony fruity freshness. The creamy mousse adds to the creaminess even more but also accentuates spiky lemon. The palate is bone dry but full of rich flavors. This is lovely now but will gain from bottle age. Drink 20172025."
"Almond and light toast aromas show the ripeness of this. On the palate, with melon and ripe kiwi flavors, the wine has an excellent balance between a strongly mineral texture and juicy fruitiness. It is a ripe wine that is ready to drink."
"This blend of 45% Cabernet Franc, 18% Malbec, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 7% Petit Verdot opens with attractive green, herbal notes of peppercorn, laurel, blackcurrant leaf and plum skin. Smooth at first, with ripe plum and berry flavors on the palate, the fine tannins offer a pronounced yet dusty grip throughout the long, dry finish. It's a well-balanced wine that should continue to gain complexity through 2022."
"A fresh lemon nose almost has a touch of herb or grass. The palate rounds this out with a balance of ripe lemon and stone-fruit freshness, while the light and creamy body offers beautifully fine fizz. A dry aftertaste has the tart freshness of green apples. The wine has an elegant, dry apritif style with wonderful length."
"Creamy notes of strawberry shortcake make for an alluring nose. The impression continues on the palate with very fine creamy mousse while the more tender, tart red-berry notes now gain some enticing pepper spice. This is a very elegant, dry apritif style. Without any dosage the finish is long, refreshing and dry."
"Weissburgunder, or Pinot Blanc, can be a rather subdued grape. But it's delightfully bright and zippy here, boasting sunny shades of apricot, grapefruit and tangerine offset against dazzling lemon-lime acidity. It's brisk and cutting on the palate yet finishes with persistence."
"This impressive, pure Merlot offers plenty of grip and concentration. Black-cherry fruit and dark chocolate, espresso and fine-grained tannins are all in play. The structure, length and polish make this a standout, especially at this price."
"Sophisticated and complex, this brings well-structured layers of citrus juice, flesh and rind. It offers a delicate herbal touch and a lingering finish. As the wine evolves in the glass, a tasty hint of honeysuckle emerges."
"The nose is shy and merely hints at lemon zestiness. The palate also opens with lemon zest but in a very concentrated full-on fashion with a citrus blast. There is a softer touch of orange and tangerine, too. The freshness is bundled and has ample drive and energy. This certainly is juicy, citrus fresh and off dry. The finish is whistle-clean and very refreshing."
"This is a co-ferment (with native yeast) of 45% Viognier, 30% Marsanne and 25% Roussanne. Exceptional details and mouth-pleasing textures lend extra pleasure throughout this Rhne white blend. Green melon, cucumber and tart tropical fruits carry the succulent and refreshing palate on through a deep dive into an immaculate finish."
"Made with dried Garganega grapes, this opens with heady aromas of passion fruit, dried nectarine slices and candied lemon. Concentrated and juicy, the delicious palate doles out peach jam, acacia honey and pastry alongside bright acidity that adds freshness."
"This elegant dry Silvaner showcases the grape's characteristically brisk green plum and herb tones against a bounty of ripe white peach, melon and peach flavors. Hints of smoke and slate and a zesty backbone of acidity lend complexity and structure through a long, lingering finish."
"Slightly fizzy and incredibly fragrant, this radiant sparkler boasts heady scents of honeysuckle, lemon blossom and white stone fruit. The crisp dry palate delivers green apple, Bartlett pear, citrus zest and a saline note alongside vibrant acidity and lightly foaming bubbles. Fermented in the bottle, it has some sediment at the bottom that adds flavor and complexity."
"From one of the larger estates in the Edna Valley, this wine has sweet-smelling plum, cherry candy and grenadine aromas. The palate is front-loaded with sagebrush, thyme, dried lavender and rosemary notes, while a hibiscus flavor unfolds in the background."
"The purest notion of Golden Pearmain apples is beguiling on the nose, promising fruit and mellowness in equal measure. The palate with its superfine and creamy mousse does not disappoint. Creamy, rich autolysis and ripe yellow apple create an elegant, generous and bright midpalate that's full of flavor and depth. It's harmonious, hitting that intersection of freshness and richness perfectly and finishing long."
"Scented mellow notes of ripe yellow apple stream from the glass. On the palate they are displayed against an autolytic background that recalls both rye bread and short-crust pastry. The mouse is very fine and adds creamy allure to the dry light palate. This is dry, classy and rather sophisticated with a refreshing finish that leaves a lasting impression."
"From 100% Pommard clone grapes, this ripe and luscious wine is packed with razor-sharp, brambly-berry fruit. Lively minerality underscores the ample acidity, keeping the wine fresh and focused. The extended finish is pleasantly peppery."
"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast. Though it feels a bit thick on the palate, it has enough acidity to avoid being flabby and is terrifically delicious. Drink now through 2021."
"Subtle aromas of mulberry, mace and vanilla meet with more intriguing notes of animal blood, rust and iodine on the nose of this bottling by Jennifer Hoage. Snappy and tart raspberry pops on the palate alongside forest underbrush and sandalwood. It's a great, balanced and even-handed entry point for those looking to explore the less ripe side of the grape."
"Exotically spiced mulberry and red currant aromas meet sumac, clove and sweet rose petal scents on the nose of this bottling from a promising new project by Jennifer Hoage. The palate blends dried sage, juniper and pine needle flavors with cherry and red plum fruit, showing complexity but a light texture."
"Produced from biodynamically grown grapes in a walled vineyard, this wine is superbly focussed. Its blackberry fruit, layers of tannins and acidity and concentration are all impressive. Rich while still keeping crispness, the wine is likely to age well over the medium-term. Drink from 2020."
Blossom and citrus inform the nosewhite jasmine hovers alongside grapefruit and orange. The palate is juicy and full of bouncy easy fruit on a fluid dryish body.

"Black as coal, with a heavy, smoky, meaty nose, this is one of a growing number of excellent biodynamic Syrahs from Oregon. It marries tangy acids to chewy red and blue fruits, with streaks of coffee liqueur and caramel latt. Half was whole-cluster fermented, and it all spent time in 50% new French oak."
"Softened by the addition of 13% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, this wine leads with smoky oak and baked bread aromas, followed by cassis and mocha notes. Medium bodied, with a seamless texture, it adds baked cherry, cedar and tomato leaf components with measured richness."
"This producer, based on the northern slopes of the Montagne de Reims, has created a tight vintage wine that is still young. With its 70% Pinot Noir it has a dry, almost tannic edge that will soften to bring out the ripe pear and apricot flavors. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
"From a pocket of Sonoma County becoming known for quality Syrah, this wine is dense in jammy strawberry and blackberry flavors, with powerful espresso and compost notesa celebration that's equal parts fruit and earth. Its expansive tannins suggest it will benefit from cellaring; enjoy 20202024."

Barrel fermented and blended from 52% Viognier and 48% Roussanne grapes, it tastes bold but bright."

"Though not labeled as such, this could be a varietal Syrah (76%), with the balance Grenache (18%) and Mourvdre.

The blue-fruit flavors are bold and full, delivering a mouthful of enjoyment that keeps you coming back for more."

"The small Szanne region of Champagne is known for its Chardonnay (as exemplified by this wine) with its crisp mineral texture. The apple-skin and green-plum flavors are given an edge by the tight acidity and dryness. It could do with another few months in bottle, so drink this bottling from 2018."
"Exotic black-fruit aromas are more surface-level than deep. This well-built Malbec has lift and intensity on the palate.

Drink through 2023."

The barrel aging is subtle and complex, with a hint of coconut in the finish."

The finish is off dry and very appetizing with its lovely balance of fruit and brightness."
"Winemakers Dan Rosenberg and Bob Bossi have dialed this wine in. While not very deep in color, it packs an incredible amount of spicy, meaty notes into the aroma and an even greater amount of ripe, luscious fruit and spice flavors into the palate. It's a gentle giant that oozes with oak accents recalling cedar, cinnamon and vanilla that sink nicely into its plump cherry and plum flavors."
"Aromas of ripe raspberry, chocolate, black olive, and green herbs all combine in this well put together wine. The palate is taut and focused, with silky tannins, mouth-watering acidity and a long herbal finish. Tightly wound, this is best sipped with food or a few years of bottle age. Drink now2024."

"A touch of citrus and herb on the nose points to the varietal character of Grner Veltliner. The palate confirms this with a yeasty, savory tinge so typical for this variety. Frothing bubbles heighten these sensations on a light, dry and full-flavored body. This wine belongs on the table with food, thanks to its long aftertaste and strong presence."
"A zesty lime-peel aroma introduces this finely textured, feather-light sptlese. It's delicate in frame yet deeply concentrated, filling the mouth with ripples of sweet white grapefruit and tangerine flavors. Ripe and fruity yet invigorating and spry, it finishes with precision."

It's firmly structured and packed with black-fruit flavors, resulting in a crushed-velvet texture. The finish is long and evolving, and this should continue to develop well through 2022."
"Though this is one of the first wines from winemaker Jennifer Hoage's own label, it's a study of soft integration from what can be a powerful site. Cherry, allspice and rose aromas lead into a palate full of wild berry and hearty sagebrush notes, framed by pitch-perfect acidity. A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience."
"Enticing aromas of chocolate-cherry cake blend seamlessly with meat, earth and baking spices. The tannins are chewy but fine grained and beautifully balanced. Tart cherries and savory olive linger on the finish. Drink now2024."

"An unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness.

This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish."

Drink now with Moroccan cuisine or stash away through 2027."
"Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish."
"There is a yeasty autolytic touch of brioche that mixes with the vivid red-apple notes of the nose which also has subtle floral overtones. The palate shows a subtle harmony of fresh tart apple, a touch of strawberry and again that tender creamy note of brioche. This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish."

"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted."
"Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025."
"A blend of Sangiovese (42%), Merlot (32%), and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery. A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish."

It's brimming with notes of cedar, sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa powder that ride atop the baked cherry and raspberry fruit.

An infant now, give it some time to further harmonize and the oak to integrate; try after 2019."

"Broadley offers well-ripened, estate-grown Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at affordable prices. This juicy, concentrated cuve brings a lively mix of boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. It was aged for one year in one-year-old French oak. The focus, concentration and sheer pleasure cannot by overstated."
"Certainly a remarkable value, this brings concentrated flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry liqueur into a big, broad and deep midpalate. The exuberance and depth of fruit is astonishing, and the balancing acidity suggests that the wine will retain its freshness through 2020 and beyond. This is one to buy by the case."
"A bright touch of candied strawberry shows prominently on the nose of this bottling, with judicious hints of roasted red pepper, herb and peppercorn hiding behind that vivacious veil.

"Exquisite lightness and weightless charm are the two obvious hallmarks of this wine. The merest touch of citrus appears on the nose. The palate has the same restraint and lemony fruit, pitched against a light froth of tiny bubbles. It's lithe and bright, with a dry, brisk finish."
"With a high percentage (67%) of Chardonnay in the blend, this is a crisp and steely wine. It has a fine elegant balance between acidity and the texture, giving delicious red fruits their place. The wine is definitely more of a food Champagne. Drink now."

Crisp apple and citrus notes underline the purity and freshness against a backdrop of subtle autolysis. The finish is bright and clean."

Alcoholic warmth is apparent on the rich sweet finish."

"Light red in color and quite cloudy in the glass, this appellation blend boasts sweet-and-sour spice on the nose, along with kalamata olive, sagebrush, tangy fig and raspberry jam aromas. Its underripe red fruit and piquant olive character on the palate will please those who enjoy the style but turn off those who don't."

"This is an unusually complex and intricate wine that has more than simple crispness. It starts with grapefruit and bitter apple aromas and builds toward vibrant but rich grapefruit, mineral and savory consomm flavors. The texture is broad and mouthfilling but well supported and balanced by acidity. A great debut for Berryhill."
"Beautifully pure and creamy notes of golden apple dominate the nose. The palate has a similarly gentle apple note that harmonizes perfectly with the light, dry body and the fine bubbles. This elegant pink sparkler will give lots of pleasure before and during a meal."

"Shy but very pure notes of ripe juicy pear and fresh ripe mirabelle plum appear on the nose. They continue seamlessly on the full-bodied palate where they find a fitting counterpoint in its phenolic texture, which has a pleasantly bitter edge. This is bone dry but unusually full-bodied for a Sylvaner, highlighting the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. The finish is long and underlines the quiet power of this wine."
"There is an earthy, funky touch on the nose at first but freshly cut peach comes through quickly, edged by the tang of lemon balm. The palate is medium-sweet and the richness makes the peachy ripeness shine. This is full on, lavish but fresh with a long medium-sweet finish."
"Aromatic and stylish, this Dijon-clone Chardonnay jumps out with sweet spices on the nose and a floral twist to the palate. Pollen, apple and white-peach flavors punch through into a well-balanced, lingering finish. It drinks nicely already but should continue to improve through 2023."
"The convergence of high alcohol, acidity and tannin will make this Super Tuscan-style blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot last quite a while.

"Redcurrant and cranberry freshness plays on the nose and palate, where they are overtaken by a bright, clean citrus streak. The fine bubbles fizz away, dispersing this lively, invigorating freshness across the palate where an edge of sourdough appears. It's a taut, brisk and refreshing wine."
"With five years' bottle aging, this Champagne is just beginning to show some attractive signs of maturity. The toasty aroma is followed through on the palate and this toastiness has softened the tight mineral texture of the wine. Drink this balanced wine now."
"With a touch more depth and complexity than Six Sigma's other offering, this wine has ripe melon and fig flavors, full body and a creamy texture that make it a standout. It's a far cry from the tangy, herbaceous sstyle of Sauvignon Blanc, bringing plenty of depth and a mouthfilling texture to the table."
"This excellent, medium-bodied wine matured in neutral oak barrels is the third of three straight outstanding vintages. It leads with earthy, smoky complexity rather than simple fruit. It smells meaty and peppery and carries those savory notes into its spicy black plum flavors."
"Beautifully pure notes of Golden Delicious apple fill the nose. The same expressive, ripe and appetizing fruitiness is also apparent on the palate which has a fine balance of ripe apple notes and crisp freshness, underpinned with a creamy bready mousse. Simply lovely and full of fruit."

A touch of spice seems reminiscent of dark fir honey. The lemon brightens and invigorates this full-fruited richness. The finish is long and medium-sweet.
"This is the winery's reserve, made just twice previously, in 2010 and 2012. Production is up sharply, and it's a ripe, round fruit pie of a wine, best enjoyed while still young. Red fruits and citrus are in the mix, with a touch of papaya. It was aged 14 months in French oak, two-thirds of it new."

"This finely balanced wine is both crisp and packed with fruit. Its mineral texture is balanced by the sliced green apple and lively acidity. With its lightly toasty aroma, it is ready to drink."
"Smooth, savory aromas of prune and blackberry are foresty and lightly herbal. This round-bodied Cab Franc from Tupungato is solid and balanced, with controlled tannins. Oaky flavors of plum, herbal tea and smoke finish savory. Drink through 2023; contains 15% Malbec."
"It's the old vines that are behind the concentration of this wine. It is rich, tight and dry with a really crisp texture and strong minerality. The acidity and the great lemon and grapefruit flavors are delicious and refreshing. Give this wine another few months for the best effect and drink from 2018."
"This old-vine Riesling matches medium sweetness (25g/L) to ample acidity. It's a dense and flavorful style, taut and fleshy at the same time. The peachy fruit hints at ripe banana as well, with a lick of butterscotch adorning the finish. Drink now through 2022."
"Made entirely with organic grapes, this delicately sparkling wine boasts enticing scents of white spring flower, beeswax and pear. The vibrant, ethereal palate is loaded with finesse, offering Rennet apple, lemon and mineral alongside crisp acidity and a light, elegant perlage."
"There's a classic touch of petrol on the nose of this bottling, as well as richer notes of candied lemon, marmalade, preserved lime and dried citrus. On the palate, it's oily and viscous, but honey, lemon syrup and tangerine zest flavors lighten it considerably. A great all-around experience."
"Fragrant yellow flower, crushed thyme, Bartlett pear and citrus aromas carry over to the dry vibrant palate together with green apple and crisp acidity. Small, continuous bubbles lend finesse."

"For this wine, grapes are sourced from cooler sites within the valley, as well as from a high-elevation site on Mount Veeder. Together, they provide a juicy, fleshy core of apple and pear girded by mineral-laden texture and tension. The finish is marked by oak-derived toast and brioche notes."
"A notion of apple peel clings to the aromas of peach and mirabelle that swirl on nose and palate. The medium-sweet body has a lightness and ease about it, but also a very earthy grounding edge. The richness is countered by some lemon freshness and a phenolic element. The finish is warm and intense."
"The wine is ripe, soft and generous. It has a fine balance between spice and rich white and green fruits. Lightly structured with a herbal edge and with pepper, it is still young. Drink this fine wine from 2018"

Honeyed ripe pear fruit fills the nose. The palate amplifies this rich notion even more with a generous touch of residual sweetness that bathes the pear fruit in caramel richness. There is a glint of pleasant phenolic bitterness here and there but the pear fruit conquers all. This is rich but fresh with a medium-sweet finish ideal for blue cheese.

The fine mousse supports this beautiful balance, while the dry finish shines with lasting lemon flavors."

A staunch, jammy, tannic red made to with meat off the grill."

"The nose is shy, showing just a few herbal hints reminiscent of yarrow. Frothy bubbles, however, pronounce the varietal character of Grner Veltliner, revealing an appealing textural element as well as herb-tinged pear fruit. Fresh, dry and light on its feet, this would be a lovely apritif."

The tannins are grippy but well integrated and while it falls a little flat on the midpalate, overall this is an interesting example of what Central Otago does best."

"Roasted blueberry aromas meet prune, caramel and purple flower notes on the nose of this port-like bottling, which is rich and inviting but not very reminiscent of Grenache. It's soft and thick on the palate, with caramel, fudge and coffee candy flavors, and would make a great pairing for dessert."
"This fresh young wine has a pleasing leesy character upon being poured. With extra breathing time it fills out, adding details of citrus pith and skin to clean green apple, melon and cucumber flavors."

"This larger production offering from the respected producer is a testament to the benefit of sourcing from multiple sites. It showcases an interesting oyster shell note, as well as robust, caramelized oak. Honey and baked apple flavors lend richness and concentration."
"A pretty nose of delicate citrus, tropical fruit and floral tones is followed by some buttery base notes. The oak is showy but there are many who will like the creamy texture and spice it brings to the palate."
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot, 6% Malbec (new this vintage) and 3% Petit Verdot. Carrying a whiff of musty leather, it nonetheless impresses with mixed black berries, a hint of cigar and polished, firm, substantial tannins. It's a fine steak wine to enjoy now through 2022."
"Aromas of buttered nuts sail forth, and turn into strong flavors set against stone fruits and skins. Details from barrel aging add nuances of spice and coconut to this tasty wine."
"Big, bold blackberry and mulled-plum aromas are ripe, briary and turn more raisiny the longer this wine sits. Raw, tart acidity and firm tannins offer structure. This wine has a palate of prune and stewed meat, with a rich yet rugged feel. Drink through 2021."

It boasts a full profile of ripe fruit tones, expressed in layers of baked cherry, plum and rhubarb cake that are accented by notes of cured bacon, leather and pressed purple flowers. The palate is surprisingly smooth and silky, thanks to resolved, approachable tannins and a lingering sweet-smoke hit on the finish."
"This is a floral wine with a tight nervy texture and intense acidity. Citrus fruit and crispness drive this forward. While it has plenty of fruit, it is this mineral texture that dominates this dry wine. Drink now."

"Made entirely with dried Traminer grapes, this offers aromas of honeysuckle, lychee and mango. The aromas follow over to the sweet rounded palate together with acacia honey notes."
"This wine's clean lines of honey, chamomile, Gala apple and ripe Asian pear grow more tropical the longer it breathes. Its medley of flavors includes candied lemon, white peach syrup and melon, but a honey-laced chamomile tea note comes out strongest."
This ripe wine is balanced with some fine bottle aging. That gives both a toasty aroma and some yeasty flavors on the palate. The wine is packed with citrus and crisp white fruitsit's floral and immediately attractive. Drink this Champagne now.
"Lemon and lemon-balm notes give a fresh impression on the nose. That same green-tinged freshness continues on the light palate, where peppery accents swish around the fizz.

"Scents of clover, stem, green herb and red currant lead into a complex wine that adds sassafras highlights as it glides into a gentle finish. Fermented with wild yeasts and aged 18 months in one-quarter new French oak, this is a well-made, though subtle expression of the variety."
"White wine is rare among producers in Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil who normally concentrate on red wines. However, this wood-aged wine from a parcel that is better suited to Chenin Blanc, has a fine texture, crisp apples even a touch of honey. It should age a little longer, so drink from 2018."
"Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fum is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes."
"Sublety and a crisp, bracing texture make this wine perfect for many different occasions. It has restrained dried thyme, mineral and lemon flavors, an appetizing tang of acidity and a rounded texture on the finish."

"A step up from the Willamette Valley cuve, this is a barrel selection from the same eight vineyards. One-third was new French oak, adding a hint of toast around wild raspberry fruit with a peppery note."
"This blend of 50% Smillon, 30% Sauvignon Blanc Clone 1 and 20% Sauvignon Musqu from Monte Rosso and Leveroni vineyards was aged in French oak. Succulent as a peach, it's intensely ripe and flavorful, with vanilla bean and melon notes and a wisp of sweetness."
"All the restrained nose gives away is a touch of lemon. The palate is similarly lean, with lemon, and a bright frothy mousse on a light, dry body. This is ideal for clean, dry and brisk refreshment. No frills but total freshness and a clean finish that shows the slightly more mellow autolysis."
"This is a beautifully fruity wine with great acidity and citrus flavors contrasting with ripe apple and melon fruitiness. The wine is cool, crisp, full of juicy acidity, and ready to drink now."

"This is crisp with a steely edge. From a single vineyard, it is a blend that is dominated by Chardonnay, the wine is tight with a texture that suggests it needs to age in the bottle. There is plenty of fruit but it just needs to soften."
"Pinot Noir thrives in the Aube region giving rich wines like this. It has a yeasty aroma which follows through to the ripe fruity palate. The wine is warm, while still crisp and tangy. This bottling is ready to drink."
A very fresh nose with hints of lemon yogurt leads on to a very sprightly lemon-dominated palate. The flavors are fresh but creamy on a very light dry body which makes most of the soft but frothy mousse. It is the lemon tinge that really lasts on the dry finish.
"There is a distinct tannic edge to this 100% Pinot Noir Champagne. It gives a firm character and with spice as well as red fruits and citrus. These elements, not quite integrated, show the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2019."
"Raisiny berry aromas come with notes of spice cake and green herbs. This wine feels narrow, hard and gritty. Uncommon flavors of fennel, licorice and bitter chocolate are as prominent if not more so than blueberry and black-plum fruit. The wine is louder and more demanding on the palate than on the finish."
"Quite pale in color, this wine offers well-defined aromas of apple, cantaloupe and pear. The palate has a textured feel and brings a pleasing sense of purity along with tart acidity. A winning offering of this seldom-seen variety, it should go particularly well at the dinner table."
"Honeysuckle, wisteria and stone-fruit aromas mingle together in the glass while the silky, semisweet palate doles out creamy yellow apple, white peach and a confectionery note. A hint of glazed hazelnut signals the close while the foaming mousse lends finesse."

"From a single parcel of old vines, this melon and kiwi-flavored wine has both a round texture and a line of crisp acidity. It is full of ripe fruit, concentrated and brimming with tangy orange acidity at the end. Drink this rich wine from 2018."

"Aromas suggesting white spring flower, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of thyme lead the way. The bright juicy palate offers ripe peach, Bartlett pear and lemon zest alongside crisp acidity and a softly sparkling perlage. It has a clean, dry finish."
"Ripe and toasty, this limited offering hints at slightly raisined fruit. Figs, dried plums and cherry leather all combine, with a rich milk-chocolate finish."
"This generous and full-bodied wine made in partnership with country singer Zac Brown has ripe fruit and sweet-seeming spice aromas that continue into the flavors, softening its gentle, already mild tannic texture. While previous vintages were from the North Coast region, this one carries the broader California appellation."
"Citrus, yellow apple and crushed herb aromas lead the way. The vibrant silky palate offers white peach and a hint of nectarine drop alongside lively acidity and a polished perlage."
"Stewed red currant, dried strawberry, sandalwood, mace and dried ginger notes show on the nose of this red. Intriguing mint, dill and anise flavors emerge on the palate, where underripe plum flavors meet black olive, dried sage and grippy tannins."
"The aromas pop, with notes of fresh blueberry pie, sweet herb, dark-roasted coffee and spice. The palate doesn't quite deliver on all those aromas, seeming a bit less bold than the nose suggests. Still, this wine is enjoyable, especially after it has time to open up."
"This light wine is still tangy and full of fruit. There are hints of age with a toasty character although that is balanced by the crisp apple acidity. So it is zesty, full of life and ready to drink."

"Aromas of crushed thyme and pressed wild flower lead the way on this linear sparkler. Crisp and bone dry, the racy palate offers pear and lime zest set against vibrant acidity and an elegant perlage."
"Raisiny, reduced aromas of baked fruits suggest overripeness. On a weighty palate this is saturated like the nose, but not overdone. Stewed black-fruit flavors are chocolaty, while this is extracted enough to leave a coating of black-fruit residue on your cheeks, tongue and teeth."
"Aromas of acacia flower, toasted nut and graphite lead the nose on this serious white. The structured palate offers mature yellow apple, honey, orange zest and almond alongside soft acidity. It closes on a lemon drop note."
"Delicate scents of spring blossom and white stone fruit lead the way. The slightly off-dry linear palate shows finesse and freshness, offering white peach, pear and green apple set against crisp acidity and a refined perlage."

"This blend of 75% Garnacha, 20% Tempranillo and 5% Viura opens with oaky aromas of cigar box, floral notes and raisin. A snappy, fresh palate reflects high elevation and a north-facing vineyard exposure, while this tastes oaky and of herbal currant and raspberry. A spicy finish of dried red-fruit notes and a saucy snap fits into the traditional mode for Rioja. Drink through 2021."
"Thick and concentrated in black and red fruit, this is a spicy, robust and oaky wine that shows the power of the vintage and site."
"Mildly stewed berry aromas come with loud oak and a strong hint of green herbs. This Cab Franc feels syrupy and chunky, with baked flavors of berry fruits and oaky chocolate. That theme of oak and chocolate carries over to the finish."
"Classic varietal aromas of tropical fruit, elderflower, tomato vine and a whiff of hay jump out of the glass. Ripe and tangy, the outgoing palate delivers grapefruit, yellow peach, honeydew melon and notion of dried herb. An oyster-shell note on the close adds interest."

"Hints of honey and caramel lend warmth to this ripe, unusually robust kabinett. Voluptuous body and haulting acidity augment its bold, expansive mouthfeel. A fringe of astringency lends some structure to the finish."
"Honey and nut aromas lead to a simple and balanced palate. Sweet flavors of caramel and sugar-coated pecan are enjoyable. On the finish, a mix of mushroom, pecan, coffee and toffee flavors are good but sticky."
"Garryana is the winery's previous moniker; once this vintage sells through all wines will be labeled Martin Woods. This bottling mixes green, gold and botrytized fruit from a single vineyard, all picked on the same day. The result is intriguing, though a bit disjointed. Bright gold, pungent and waxy in the mouth, it mixes accents of honeycomb with green-apple fruit that almost tastes like straight cider. The finish is quite dry."
"Fruity aromas of ripe orchard fruit and citrus zest mingle with fragrant spring blossom. The rather sweet palate doles out ripe peach, green apple and a confectionery note. A foaming mousse lends finesse while bright acidity lifts the finish."
"This is a soft and creamy-textured wine. Its crisp apple aromas bring out the bright character as well as the ripe lemon and green-plum fruitiness. It is floral, stylish and ready to drink."
"This is a delicious, apple-flavored wine. With just the right balance of ripeness and acidity, it is both crisp and fruity. There is a fine tang of minerality at the end. Drink now."
"Yeasty funk that has notions of quince, lemon and beer makes for an interesting and fruity nose. The palate brings tart and pure red apple, bright lemon and a touch of aromatic stone fruit. The fizz on this pt nat is very tender and subtle, but the purity of fruit and the wonderful texture of the wine make it rather convincing and moreish."
"Yeasty, robust tannin meets dark baked fruit and tangy tea notes in this full-bodied, intensely built wine. A stemmy, earthy component adds savoriness and complexity."
"Pale, almost Provence ros in color, this fruity soft wine is delicious and attractively balanced. Red currant and raspberry fruits give it a crisp character as well as acidity. There is a fine, tangy aftertaste. Drink now."
"Rich and creamy, this is a delicious, ripe, and full style of Sauvignon. It has a light vanilla edge from its creamy texture as well as intense green-fruit acidity. The wine is concentrated and will be better to drink from 2018."
"Aromas of applesauce and pear syrup are ripe and friendly. On the palate, this brut nature feels boxed in and lacking in breadth. Flavors of apple and green herbs are lightly oxidized, while this finishes dry and briny on hints of stone fruit and melon."
"A portion of this was fermented in terracotta amphorae, then blended into the finished wine. It amps up textures, lending a cola and club-soda-style minerality that underscores the pretty strawberry and Bing-cherry fruit."
"Gritty aromas of road tar and green herbs are offset by spicy black-fruit scents and a hint of root beer. This Cab Franc feels dense and chewy. Herbal plum and currant flavors include spicy oak notes. It tastes woody, minty and toasty on a full finish."
"Silky and fresh, this bright sparkler delivers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear and creamy white peach. Tangy acidity and a foaming perlage provide the polished backdrop."

"California-based Siduri cellared and bottled this wine that was vinified in Oregon. Still young and compact, it nonetheless shows some good flesh on its bones. The tannins pop out a bit, along with red berries and a streak of coffee. Another year of bottle age would be helpful, or give it plenty of aeration."
"Traditionally one of the major Champagne brands, this delicious crisp wine retains the Lanson house style. It is tight, fruity while having a mineral edge. White fruits and citrus combine easily to give a wine that is ready to drink."
"Floral scents of honeysuckle and citrus blossom mingle with white stone fruit aromas. The lively weightless palate doles out white peach and green apple framed in bright acidity and a polished perlage. It has a clean, refreshing finish."
"This warm, ripe wine, with its balance between creamed quince and lemon acidity, is immediately attractive with its fruitiness, its touch of minerality and its final bright acidity. Drink now."
"Tangy in nature, this wine has heaps of ripe red fruit, cola, Moroccan spices and orange peel, with licorice root and tart cranberry woven into an elegant palate. There's power and ageability to this Marlborough Pinot, but it's also begging to be enjoyed with a tagine. Drink now2024."
"The original home of the Sauvion family, this estate has produced a ripe generous style of wine with fresh fragrant aromas. It has a soft texture with green-apple fruits right up front. Drink this ripe crisp wine now."
"Earthy black-fruit aromas include notes of cigar box. This feels tight and acidic, but with plenty of oak. Flavors of woodspice and vanilla are more dominant than plum and berry notes, while this is thick but not entirely thorough on the finish."
"Charred, smoky blackberry aromas are chocolaty and stout. This Malbec has a rubbery palate with clamping tannins. Saucy, herbal berry flavors come with a mild green influence, finishing a bit clipped and angular."
"Bachelder is a Canadian winery but this wine was grown, produced, bottled and aged in Oregon. It's full bodied, with an earthy, slightly smoky character. Suggestions of root beer and black cherry cola thread into a tannic finish, with plenty of grip."

"Delicate scents evoking jasmine, citrus and exotic fruit mingle together on this creamy sparkler. On the off-dry palate, crisp acidity and persistent bubbles lift white peach, yellow pear and candied nectarine."
"Aromas of white flower, crushed rock and pear lift out of the glass. Dry and refreshing, the palate offers yellow apple, acacia and a hint of citrus alongside crisp acidity."
"Spicy, slightly green aromas of plum and currant open this Cabernet Franc. The tight, solid palate is light in feel and not overextracted. Saucy, oaky flavors of berry fruits, spice and cocoa finish with a distinct flavor of oak. Drink through 2019."
"Tart red currant and red apple mingle with tangy citrus on nose and palate. Very frothy lively mousse fizzes across the palate, making it refreshing and appetizing. The citrus and tart red-fruit notes appear again on the clean dry finish, making it moreish and long."
"The nose is rather shy and just hints at citrus freshness. The palate, however, fizzes with expressive lively lemon notes which are presented on a light, fruity, inherently fresh and dry body. This is easy and totally refreshing and finishes on a lovely lemon note."
"Cab Franc makes a strong case for being top gun among this region's reds. This estate-grown example has been vinified for aromatics, elegance, balance and detail, and succeeds beautifully. Juicy boysenberry and blueberry fruit is buoyed with ample acidity. The flavors penetrate through a clean, crisp, lingering finish. Just 60 cases were exported to the U.S."
"This is a very summery bottling, with bright, fruity aromas recalling guava, peach, gardenia, pineapple and lemon-lime soda. That fruit salad aspect persists on the palate, but it's cut by a powerful burst of acidity, making it great for lakeside sipping."
"This blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier is full bodied and rich. Red-berry aromas are followed on the palate with tangy apricot and strawberry fruitiness. It is a ripe wine, ready to drink."

"Delicate crushed mineral and lemon aromas turn riper and fruitier on the palate. While not deeply complex, its plush, pristine white peach and tangerine flavors are lip smacking. It's zippy acidity and clean, mineral finish lend refreshment."
"Bright and bouncy, this gluggable Pinot Noir sings with juicy red berry fruit, a touch of cinnamon and an earthy core. Texturally silky with a savory finish, this easy-going sipper deserves 20 minutes in the fridge to really turn up the refreshment dial."
"Lovely and fresh, this wine opens with heady scents of beeswax, wild flower and apple. The bright palate offers ripe pear, creamy peach and citrus alongside bright acidity and light mineral note."
Chardonnay planted in the mainly Pinot Noir area of the Montagne de Reims is the base of this off-dry wine. It is only just north of Brut with its mineral texture well intact and the creamed apple flavor coming to the fore. Drink both with food or as an apritif.
"One-quarter of this wine was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel. At 12.5% alcohol, the light, almost airy wine brings immaculate fruit flavors of apple and pear, with a pleasing, minerally mouthfeel. It offers the faintest suggestion of caramel as it winds down."
"Creamy and crisp, this boasts enticing scents of hawthorn and black locust flower while the tangy palate evokes tangerine, white peach and green apple. Vibrant acidity brightens the fruit flavors."

"A dark, roasted, smoky opening is the greeting on this burly Tempranillo from Zamora. Grabbing tannins pinch like squeaky rubbery, while this tastes of savory, roasted black fruits. A meaty, chewy, tannic finish is confirmation of overall toughness. Drink through 2021."
"Rhne variety-focused winemaker Larry Schaeffer ventures into Bordeaux territory with this bottling, which he recommends served with a slight chill. Smooth berry aromas meet grapeseed and crushed plum on the nose. The palate is light, fresh and easy to enjoy, with red fruit and dried herb flavors, proving easy to quaff."
Green apple and honeysuckle aromas follow through to the fresh polished palate along with nectarine drop and white peach. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors while a creamy mousse lends finesse.
"With 65% of the two Pinot grapes, this is a rich wine with a light structure of tannins. It also has great red fruits and balanced acidity. There is a softness to the aftertaste which will make it a good apritif style."
"Although the alcohol is near 15%, the dark black cherry and cassis fruit keeps pace. Savory elements infuse aromas and flavors, with smoke, espresso, and char evident in the thick, drying tannins. This wine is a bruiser, so have a steak on the grill for best enjoyment."

"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish."
"This savory, spicy wine is relatively light but offers a tasty combination of non-fruit flavors such as black pepper, beef broth and wood smoke. It's medium bodied, lightly tannic and quite complex for its moderate concentration."
"This naturally cloudy pt nat smells both of yeast and freshly cut russet-pear peel, giving an impression of full, ripe fruit. The palate has the same fresh pear notes as well as that textural element of peel. Bone dry, it comes with finest fizz and is utterly refreshing, if rustic. It would shine as a full-flavored picnic wine, with a lastingly dry finish."
"There's more to this wine than just citrus and grass. On the nose it's floral and nutty, with a hint of ginger. The palate shows more nuttiness alongside waxy lemon, herbs and with some textural weight. Sip with Southeast Asian cuisine."
"Ripe red-apple notes set the tone on the nose. The fruit aroma becomes rounder on the palate, edged with lemon freshness and enlivened by frothy fizz. This has a light body and fruity ease. The finish is dry and mouthwatering."

"A whiff of elderflower and nettle appears on the nose before creamier hints of autolysis and green apple come in. The nettle makes another brief, aromatic appearance while the palate comes together to balance bright, green-apple crispness with mellow, subtly rich yeastiness. The bubbles are fine and soft, the finish is brisk and enlivening. It's a wonderfully harmonious, fresh apritif style."

"A lovely blend of tart berry and red-apple notes creates an inviting nose. The palate brings these lovely, almost autumnal berry notes even further as they are amplified by the lively frothy mousse. This is totally fruit driven, very appetizing and refreshing with an almost cleansing but lasting finish."
The enticing tartness of red and green apples dominates the appetizing nose. These crisp notes are heightened by a very lively frothing mousse on a light dry palate that shows both autolysis and freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and very refreshing and has a lasting hint of yeast.
"Aromas have a pleasing toastiness, built around pretty strawberry fruit. The mouthfeel is a bit granular, balanced and highlighted with flavors of cocoa and coffee. It offers a relatively good value in Willamette Valley Pinot Noir."
"This wine's mellow petrol notes meet lemon pith and crushed chalk on the nose for a fresh introduction. The palate is grippy and structured, presenting rounded tangerine and candied lime flavors, with the slightest hint of petrol."
"This opens with subtle aromas suggesting wild flower and orchard fruit. Round and ripe, the palate shows tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus peel alongside a saline note."

"Black-cherry fruit comes wreathed in light smoke, with a streak of root beer adding to the flavor. This is a wine of medium weight and concentration, with hints of fennel throughout."

Honeysuckle and green apple aromas follow over to the lively palate along with pear and a hint of lime. Vibrant acidity and a lively perlage give it a clean energized finish.
"Brambly berry pushes front and center, with well-modulated notes of dried herb, black olive and bark. This is structured, balanced and immediately drinkable, but should keep through 2022."
"Appetizing notes of strawberry and Red Delicious apple create an inviting opening. These same flavors play on the very frothy, totally fruit-driven but dry palate. This is fresh and refreshing and with its fruit-forward style, it's an ideal pale-pink drink for summer parties."
"The wine is all fruit: red berries and red currants bursting from the glass. The red wine used to give color has added an edge of tannic texture to the ripe fruitiness. In the house style of this producer, the wine is dry and crisp at the end. Drink now."
"Made from 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Merlot, this offers juicy blackberry and black cherry flavors, with a tart underbelly of acidity. Firm tannins and oak notes support the rounded, brightly fresh fruit."

"Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of white flower and a whiff of orchard fruit. The fresh palate offers lemon and pear alongside bright acidity and a tangy hint of crushed oyster shell."
"Lighter and livelier than typical California Viognier, this has crisp apple and citrus aromas, nicely tangy fruit flavors and relatively light body. It feels juicy but lean rather than rich, in a refreshing alternative style."
This is an unusual 100% Pinot Meunier Champagne. Its stark dryness is balanced by the natural softness of the grapes to give a rounded wine full of spicy apple balanced by fine textured acidity. Ready to drink now.
"Made in a careful, non-intrusive, natural style, this combines wild strawberry and peppery herb flavors. It offers moderate tannins and a strongly herbal finish."
"A closed nose with aromas of prune and earthy berry fruits turns more gamy and funky as this blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Syrah and Grenache breathes. A heavy, saturated palate is generous but ponderous. Flavors of wild berry, herbal plum and lemony oak finish tannic and tough. Drink through 2025."
"Fairly elegant and reserved on the nose, this shows black raspberry and boysenberry notes, along with leather and baking spice. It's medium-bodied on the palate, with candied strawberry, fennel pollen and wild herb flavors."
"Delicate scents of honeysuckle and white stone fruit mingle together on this. It's fresh and polished, with green-apple, white-peach and nectarine flavors balanced by crisp acidity and a silky perlage."
"Rounded ripe Chardonnay is the backbone of this accessible wine. Yes, it is crisp with an edge of steeliness, but its acidity is tempered by the rich lime and apricot flavors. The wine is ripe, fruity and ready to drink."
"Floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine take center stage on this polished off-dry sparkler. On the silky palate, fresh acidity enlivens rich flavors of creamy white peach, candied citrus drop and ripe yellow apple while a refined bead lends elegance."
"This bottling is extremely light in aroma and flavor (though both will increase with bottle age), so its texture is its strongest selling point. Faint peach skin, nectarine flesh, melon and citrus aromas lead into a perfectly grippy palate, where citrus peel and beeswax flavors crescendo into the finish."
"Aromas of pressed spring flower, peach blossom and yellow stone fruit take center stage. The dense full-bodied palate offers ripe yellow plum, dried apricot and rosemary honey."

"The nose of this bottling from the Camp Four and El Camino Real vineyards is reductive at first, but it shows lemon curd, grapefruit rind and wet cement notes as it opens. The palate is bright, clean and tight, with a grippy texture and preserved lemon and bitter orange flavors."
"Powerful berry, cassis and licorice aromas are intense on the surface but shallow underneath. A raw, extracted palate is rough and edgy in feel. Ripe blackberry flavors are savory. It's tough, grating and rubbery across a long finish."
"Delicate yellow peach and crushed mineral on the nose extend to the palate of this brisk, zesty Pinot Blanc. It's a refreshing, light footed wine but a bit lean and a bit austere in style. Drink now."
"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and pressed acacia flower waft out of the glass. On the bright palate, racy acidity underscores yellow apple and Bartlett pear alongside a lively polished perlage."

"Coming from Waterbrook Estate, Blackrock and Summit View vineyards, this offers high-toned aromas, with notes of flower, soil and bittersweet chocolate. The palate is full of bold flavors backed by lively acidity and firm, slightly dry tannins. It's a high-quality example of the variety, though it could use some steak to tame the tannins."
"Subtle notes of tart red apple and red currant rise from the glass. They also feature prominently on the palate where their fruit expression is heightened by lively fine fizz. The body is light and inherently fresh, making this an ideal and very appetizing apritif."
"This maverick wine looks cloudy and orange in hue and offers citrus zest and peach skin aromas. That's because it was fermented with the grape skins, like a red wine. A plethora of flavors comes through on the palate, from peach and almond to jasmine and prosciutto, and it has a mouthfilling texture. Know that it's not a mainstream wine but enjoy it anyway."
"Enticing aromas of wisteria and white spring flower rise from the glass on this fragrant sparkler. The crisp dry palate is more restrained, offering yellow apple and lemon zest alongside racy acidity and a vibrant perlage."

"The nose already shows the lemon freshness of the palate. Frothy bubbles disperse the fruity easy freshness even more on the light palate leading to a dry, clean and appetizing finish with a lovely lemony streak."
"The vineyard lies in the Van Duzer corridor, and the regular winds thicken the grape skins, giving chewy, astringent tannins. Tart plum and wild-cherry fruit flavors carry a peppery bite. The wine was aged for nine months in a neutral barrel of Oregon oak."
"A ripe, powerful Pinot, this wine is bursting with sweet cherry, chocolate and vanillan oak spice. The palate brings forth more ripe fruit with chewy but well structured tannins and a savory finish. Drink now2024."

"This drinks a bit lighter than previous vintages, with light strawberry and thin, tart cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent and slightly green. It's worth cellaring until 2019 to let additional bottle age smooth out the finish."

Made in a stainless steel instead of oak barrels, it has all the freshness one could want."

"This is a wine of great intensity. Its tight texture and citrus fruits work hard to produce a strongly floral wine that has a steely character. It certainly needs some age, so drink from 2019."
Honeysuckle and green apple aromas follow over to the foaming palate along with white peach and grapefruit. A candied lemon drop note caps off the finish while bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.

"The nonvintage blend from this producer reveals the house style with its crisp character, tangy citrus fruits and great acidity. It is floral, fruity while also sitting on the dry side of Brut. Drink this finely balanced wine now."

"Raspberry, cocoa, coffee and vanilla aromas lead to plump, focused fruit flavors. It's both appealing and quite varietally correct. For those looking for a quality value Merlot, look no further."

Medium tannins lend a framing structure to the ripe fruit flavors, finishing on whispers of pencil lead and toasted oak."
"Leathery, scratchy black-fruit aromas are striated and minty, with a note of oak. This Monastrell feels grabby, hefty and on the bold and bulky side. Jammy blackberry flavors come with minty green notes, while this tastes mildly grassy and feels a bit hot on the finish."

"Apple, pear and spice aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that manage to remain light on their feet. The finish seems a bit clipped but it still delivers enjoyment."
"Raisin aromas could use a bit more lift and freshness. This Rioja feels grabby due to rubbery tannins. Soupy, slightly herbal berry flavors finish on chocolaty notes but also a choppy sense of roughness."
"This Rioja Baja Garnacha is earthy on the nose, with aromas of stewed berry fruits, tomato and raisin. The palate is livelier than the aromas, but this still feels a bit heavy and stewed. Flavors of vanilla, root beer and saucy berry fruits lack pop on a finish that seems to be tiring."
"Supple and seamless, this lightly spicy wine is a good all-purpose white. The clean, crisp fruit touches on kiwi, pear and a hint of green banana. Vinified in stainless steel, it's a refreshing wine that should be enjoyed soon."
"Aged a mere five months in oak, this fresh offering is nutty and expansive on the palate, presenting brawny, full-bodied pineapple and anise flavors. Concentrated and ripe, it's for fans of the style."
"This wine starts on the shy side but with several minutes in glass reveals delicate notes of lemon-lime, watermelon rind and grass along with a touch of butter in the background.

"This perfumed ripe wine is full of delicious fruit. Its fine apple and pear flavors are cut with pink grapefruit to give an intensely textured wine, refreshing, crisp and ready to drink."

"Heavyweight aromas of molasses and honey are friendly but flat. A dry, drawing palate holds nutty, salty walnut flavors that run only so deep before bottoming out. A tight, basic finish doesn't waver."
"A gold color and oaky aromas of popcorn, buttered corn and stone fruits open this chunky, resiny, oak-heavy Chardonnay. Oaky, buttery flavors carry over from the nose, and oak spice dominates the finish on this full-bodied but not very fruity offering."
"Soft red fruit adorns this light-bodied take on the variety. From the heart of the appellation, it has moderate acidity and a flavor profile characterized by rose petal, orange and cherry."

"There's power in this wine amidst the notes of waxy lemon, peach pit and blossoms. The bitterness of melon rind comes in on the finish, but there's enough acidity to keep the palate refreshing, interesting, and quite food friendly."
"A blend of 90% Chardonnay with 10% Pinot Blanc makes this a Blanc de Blancs (not indicated on the label). The wine itself is fruity, soft and with creamed-apple acidity to give it a lift. The light mousse gives a gentle aftertaste. Drink now."
"Intensely ripe and chocolatey, this full-bodied wine swims in blueberry and blackberry jam flavors, slathered with graham cracker and vanilla sweetness. Broadly appealing, soft and round, it takes on a cola note as it finishes."
"This wine is 90% Syrah, with the balance Grenache (8%) and Mourvdre. The aromas are reserved initially, with notes of blueberry pie, dark-roasted coffee and raspberry. The palate is surprisingly light for the aromas (and producer), with the finish seeming attenuated. The oak also comes off as a bit heavy."
"As is often the case when a ros has been made taking the color from the skins rather than the more usual addition of red wine, this perfumed Champagne is dark coloredvery pink. The fruit of this dry wine gives a red-currant flavor, with lively acidity and a crisp, tang aftertaste."
"This popular bottling offers the tropical fruit salad array it always has, with honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, guava and banana aromas. Yet, this particular vintage has a refreshing zestiness. Steely structure and lime-like acidity drive the palate, balancing its buttercream and peach custard flavors."
"Demure lemon and honey aromas are amplified on the palate of this juicy, fruity kabinett. While easy drinking and straightforward in style, it's a deeply concentrated Riesling full of stonefruit and citrus delight. Enjoy now for its approachable, sunny flavors."
Aromas evoking spring wild flower and ripe orchard fruit open on the nose while the vibrant straightforward palate offers green apple and a citrusy note. Bright acidity and a soft persistent perlage provide the backdrop.
The touches of wood aging are apparent in the almond and toasty edge to this perfumed wine. Quince and apricot fruit show strongly through the tight dry texture and minerality. It's a wine made to be drunk young with great fruit. Drink now.

"Fermented in concrete tanks, using whole-clusters and wild yeast, this is not a mainstream wine. Light bodied and tangy, it has has aromas and flavors that recall sour cherries, plus earthy, meaty accents, prominent acidity and a firmly tannic finish."
"Citrus, orchard-fruit and spring-blossom aromas float out of the glass. Mirroring the nose, the slightly sweet, creamy palate tastes of white peach, apple and candied citrus peel offset by fresh acidity and a foaming perlage."
"Chocolate notes fill the aroma of this rich, luscious wine, and blackberry jam and maple syrup flavors follow on the palate. It's sweet, soft and full bodied and may be just the thing to quiet down an especially spicy Korean barbecue."
"A generous and ripe wine, this is rich with citrus, apple along with hints of tropical fruits. The mineral texture gives the wine its shape and brings out the full-throated fruitiness. It is a wine to age for a few months, so drink from 2018."
"Aromas of plum and blue fruit are accented by high-toned spices and milk chocolate. Flavors are soft, palate coating and poised, with blue-fruit flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't necessarily taste like Merlot but still brings plenty of appeal."

"Chardonnay from three grand cru villages in the Cte des Blancs, this tense mineral wine is bone dry with citrus and apple crispness. It is tight and nervy, still young and needing to age further. This will be ready to drink from late 2018."
"Having spent time in both oak and stainless steel, this wine offers intense golden toast flavor and focused acidity, the fruit recalling grapefruit pith and melon."
"Ripe yellow apple and peach abound in this bold, big-bodied Pinot Gris. Yielding acidity and a plush, creamy mouthfeel augment its lusciousness, but a bristle of tannins lends structure to the finish. Enjoy while young."
"This wine's firm, almost chewy texture makes it lively and lip-smacking, with tart red and black cherry flavors that provide good intensity and length. It's made from a grape variety that's widely used in Champagne but rarely seen as a varietal still wine."
"Bright, ripe, seemingly sweet fruit fills the aromas and flavors of this soft and generous wine blended from Pinot Noir, Pinotage and Pinot Meunier grapes. It floods the palate with rich raspberry and black cherry notes. And since the tannins are very light and the acidity low, it has a pillowy texture."

"Made with 95% Garganega and 5% Chardonnay, this has aromas of maple syrup, dried white flower and candied orange zest. The round palate doles out dried apricot, candied tangerine and acacia honey."
Tart red berries like red currant and strawberry dominate the nose. They also play on the palate where frothy lively fizz foams and disperses the flavors across the light dry palate. This is vivacious and very refreshing.
"Dominating aromas of clove and baking spices are forced and oak-based, and thus not natural. In the mouth, this lusty, extracted Malbec feels raw and choppy, with rough tannins. Flavors of clove, savory berry fruits and green herbs continue on the finish."
This good-value wine done in a light and lovely style offers flavors of red berries and cherry cola highlighted by toasted hazelnuts. A touch of caf crme leads into a softly focused finish.

"Done in a light style, this is a gentle, yet persistent and well-balanced wine. A wisp of melon leads into more robust flavors of apple and peach, with a tart, pleasing, toasty finish."
"Smooth, ripe, robust and round, this wine circles the bases in full-bodied flavor and build, showing intense black jammy fruit and dark chocolate notes."
"This spent 16 months in French oak, and the barrel influences overtake the light strawberry fruit. At the moment the wine seems to lack complexity. Additional bottle age may help to address that and rebalance the fruit/oak flavors. For now, it's clean and toasty, with a streak of cola."
"The merest hint of red currant plays on the subtle nose. The tender red-currant fruit is enhanced by the very lively frothy mousse that fizzes away on the palate. This is light, fruit-driven, refreshing and easyideal as an enlivening apritif."
"This Carmel Valley-based winery has modernized its label without losing its classic appeal.

Rounded lemon curd, browned butter and orange cream flavors show on the palate, with a strong honeysuckle element and a caramelized finish."
"Fairly reserved on both the nose and palate, this bottling begins with roasted apple, peach and chalk scents. The palate offers lemon and grapefruit peel and Gravenstein apple flavors."

"Based in Epernay, this Champagne house specializes in bone-dry Champagnes. Like this bottling, they need some time before the acidity calms down. This has the potential to be delicious, crisp, and full of a bright mineral texture and citrus fruitiness. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is flashy and there's no denying that, starting with a heady nose of toast, smoke and orange peel. The palate is viscous and grainy on notes of mint and ginger, with barely enough acidity to maintain balance. Nonetheless, it is inherently appealing."
"This is a spicy wine, its fruit merged with toastiness and almond flavors. Fermentation in wood has created a wine that has layers of flavors as well as crisp honeyed fruit and acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
"Made entirely with Ribolla Gialla, this has aromas of Abate Fetel pear and white spring flower. The fresh savory palate offers yellow peach, lemon zest and a pleasant note of bitter almond alongside bright acidity."
"From premier cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims, this finely balanced wine is tight and crisp with fine acidity. Its white fruits and lively feel are allied to a creamy texture to produce a Champagne that is ready to drink now."
"This is a three-barrel reserve, principally Pommard clone, and vinified with minimal handling. Cherry/berry fruit comes with ample acidity. The alcohol, though just at the high end of moderate, seems to mute some of the details. Notes indicate that no additions were made, but the finish remains a bit chalky."
"Oaky butterscotch and baked pear notes give this lushly composed white equal parts heat and body. The apple flavor seems baked and warming on the palate, lending additional richness on the toast-laced finish."
"There's a tropical touch to this wine's mellow and light nose, but that opulent fruit is cut by lemon, red apple and mandarin zest. Fresh pluot and tropical candy notes show on the zippy palate."
"Crisp and drier than this Champagne used to be, this is a fruity wine. Apples, citrus and zesty orange mingle along with the minerality that comes from the 40% Chardonnay in the blend. This is a fine apritif style to drink now."
"This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting."
"Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction."

"The age on this bottling is starting to show, so drink up. Slightly sour plum scents meld with rose petal, violet and dried blueberry notes on the nose. The palate is quite interesting, with dried strawberry, mocha and cappuccino flavors, culminating in a caramel-inflected finish."
"The nose is shy and does not want to show its fruit. The very frothy, light palate displays hints of ripe yellow apple and glints of citrus. This is balanced and shows its fruit reluctantly but comes together beautifully on the dry finish."
"This 100% varietal wine hails from Blackrock, Mirage and Summit View vineyards. Barrel notes of cocoa, vanilla and coconut are at the fore, along with notes of dried cranberry and cherry. The palate is full bodied, with luscious fruit and barrel flavors that provide appeal."
"Honeysuckle, lily of the valley and a whiff of exotic fruit aromas take center stage. The silky palate offers sweet white peach, candied nectarine slice and banana alongside a soft mousse."

"Paraffin, grapefruit pith, pungent smoke and citrus candy scents show on the nose of this bottling, which is a bit reductive and needs some time to breath. When it does, its honey, lime peel and wet cement flavors emerge."

"This wine opens with aromas of ultraripe grapes, despite the relatively moderate listed alcohol. Baking spices, Christmas cake, plum pastry and almost Port-like flavors (without the alcoholic heat) suggest that very ripe grapes were included in the the mix of fruit. Drink up."
"Dried citrus lift with honeyed overtones on the nose signals ripeness of fruit. The same honeyed note plays on the palate where frothy mousse accentuates a pleasantly bitter edge. The body is light and fresh, always with that honeyed tone, and finishes dry."
Here's a lively sparkler loaded with scents of apple and pear. The aromas carry over to the vibrant palate along with lemon and lime. Crisp acidity and a continuous perlage lead into a dry refreshing close.
"Cocoa, raspberry and dark-chocolate aromas are followed by chocolaty barrel flavors that persist on the finish. There's enjoyment to be had but the oak seems a bit out front."
"This single-vineyard, pure varietal wine shows the strengths of the region. It offers lovely floral aromatics along with cured, smoked meat. Those flavors thread through a midpalate with purple and black fruits, more smoke, olives and chewy tannins."
"Green-fruit aromas and intense, tangy fruit define this wine. It is strongly herbal, bringing out a zesty character that is right up front. It is probably a few months away from being ready to drink, so wait until summer 2018."
"Saucy scents accent core cherry aromas, along with sandalwood and herbal notes. This wine has a lively, pinching palate that is high in acidity. Herbal flavors of tomato sauce and red plum finish long due to racy, raw acidity."
"This is fragrant and forward, with a subtle smoky element. Fresh raspberry fruit comes wrapped in flavors of toast, malt and milk chocolate. It's smooth and appealing, best consumed now through 2020."
"Entirely stainless-steel fermented and aged, this crisp white for immediate drinking is from a great vineyard site considered ground zero for the variety. Grass, pea shoot and corn aromas lead the way, as its tart, dry apricot and melon flavors beg for oysters."
"The ripe black-cherry fruit brings immediate appeal, in an unapologetically fruity, forward style. The acids are in perfect harmony, and the overall balance is just right, with a juicy, tangy snap to the finish."
"Tropical ripeness teases on the entry of this wine, before its lush, fleshy texture takes over. Its golden apple, pear and mango flavors combine effortlessly, while an underlying minerality plays upon the palate."
"This wine has thick, ripe fruit and texture, making it robust and intense. Forest floor, black tea and tobacco notes give it memorable savoriness."

"Aromas are high toned and barrel-forward, with notes of vanilla, green wood and cocoa. The fruit is able to break through on the palate that shows a pleasing sense of balance."
Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and citrus zest carry on to the lively palate along with a hint of ginger. Crisp acidity and small continuous bubbles provide a fresh elegant backdrop.
"The nose and palate of this wine are quite mellow for the first few hours after opening but grow more compelling with time, so decanting is strongly recommended. Pepper, subtle blueberry, coffee and slate aromas lead into chocolate, black plum, charcoal and soy flavors on the palate."
"The aromas are bright, with notes of guava, pineapple and citrus. The palate is lightly spritzy with plenty of grapefruit flavors that keep the interest high."
"Delicate aromas of white spring blossom and white stone fruit rise from the glass. On the vibrant palate, a hint of almond adds interest to yellow pear and a citrus zest note. It closes crisp and clean."

"Light in body, shades of green plum and freshly cut grass lend freshness to riper flavors of apricot and honey in this off-dry Riesling. Fresh and fruity, it's sprightly on the palate, with wide appeal."
"This still-young crisp wine is full of apple and citrus acidity. The mousse is lively, giving a bright character to this fruity wine. Because it is so dry, it needs another few months before drinking, so wait until 2018."
"Aromas of ripe white stone fruit and a whiff of toasted nut lift out of the glass. Mirroring the nose, the lively foaming palate doles out white peach, pear, glazed almond and citrus zest. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors."
"Pretty to look at and lovely in the mouth, this all-Pinot ros offers gentle hints of plum, sour cherry and orangeade. Bracing acidity puts a tight, tangy twist to the finish."
"Lively, fruity and well made, this wine has plenty of raspberry and cherry flavors, good acidity and light tannins to add a bit of grip to the texture. For a medium-bodied wine, it has nice concentration."
"This is a structured style of ros with a tannic edge as well as red-currant flavors. It is fruity, dry and with fine refreshing acidity to finish this fragrant wine. Drink now."
A blend of bready aromas along with crisp apple and pear scents leads to a citrusy palate of lime and green melon. The lasting finish is a good way for things to conclude.
"Aromas of spring blossom and green apple lift out of the glass. Silky and bright, the off-dry palate presents ripe pear, white peach and candied nectarine zest alongside a creamy mousse and fresh acidity."
"Fragrant spring flower, citrus blossom and orchard fruit aromas leap from the glass. The slightly off-dry tangy palate presents ripe green apple, white peach and a juicy note of candied lemon drop offset by crisp acidity and a lively perlage."

"There's a light nectarine touch on the nose of this bottling, alongside coconut and Bosc pear aromas and a kiss of oak. It's a tad ripe on the palate, with lemon cream flavors, but compelling acidity, grippy structure and lime pith bitterness all keep it in check."
"Spring wild flower and green apple aromas lead the nose. The apple note follows over to the racy palate, joining white peach and citrus peel. Brisk acidity and a vivacious perlage offset the fruity flavors."

"This is a good, well-made wine that hits the spot, with lively apple and citrus aromas, fresh and crisp fruit flavors, a lively mouthfeel and tangy finish. It will be easy to pair with appetizers, seafood and light entrees."
"Yeasty aromas include briny notes of citrus and stone fruits, while on the palate, this is tangy and tight. Flavors of briny citrus, pickle and kimchee are zesty on a finish. This is not clean like polished crystal; funk and brine are key players on this Cava."
"A nod to this winery being the 107th ever bonded in the country, this widely available bottling is a good deal. It opens with dried sage, tart cherry and pomegranate aromas, which lead into a light and airy palate full of cranberry fruit and garrigue notes, especially lavender and fennel pollen."

These are followed by full-bodied black-cherry and spice flavors along with gritty tannins. It dips a bit in the middle and the oak seems a bit heavy, but it still delivers enjoyment."

"This dry estate wine is voluptuous and richly floral, with well-developed stone fruit and melon flavors. Medium-bodied, it's weighty enough to be enjoyed on its own or at the table with a wide array of foods."
"You've got to dig for them a little, but eventually this wine offers aromas of ginger, white flowers and almonds with a whiff of green beans followed by a citrusy, pithy palate. The finish doesn't last as long as you'll wish it did. Nevertheless, this is a solid example of the region's flagship variety."

"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front."
"Aromas of toasty barrel spices, vanilla, cedar, high-toned herbs and plums lead to tart cranberry flavors. The tannins give a firm squeeze and this wine shows a bit of heat, but is otherwise appealing."
"A blend of fruit from Canoe Ridge and Wallula vineyards, this puts the oak (40% new French) at the fore. Aromas of vanilla and baking spice lead to buttery, creamy, full-fruit flavors. The oak and malolactic influence is not shy but it's a good choice for those seeking that style."

"Mainly Pinot Meunier, as befits a producer in the Marne Valley, this Champagne is soft and creamy. With its edge of acidity, baked-apple flavor and zingy texture, the wine is ready to drink."
"This wine is a bit reduced out of the gate, providing distraction from its aromas of burnt toast, apple, pear and spice. The palate is creamy in feel, with buttery flavors along with a lemony finish. If the reduction blows off it could move up a notch or two."
"A streak of coffee runs dramatically down a tight, snappy core of citrus and berry fruit. Flavors are lightly dusted with pepper, remaining bright and precise through the finish."
"Certainly on the dry side, this wine is also full of ripe fruit giving it a rich character. Creamed apples and attractive acidity are given a fine zesty textured edge. It comes from a producer in the Aube region in the south of Champagne."
"Based in the Cte de Szanne, this producer has created a Pinot Noir-dominated blend. Its white stone-fruit aromas and soft texture point to a wine that is generous with its fruitiness, citrus and pear flavors leading the way. The wine is soft with a relatively high dosage. It is ready to drink."

"A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable."
"Green notes lead the parade here: Grass, peas and tomato leaf march ahead of the lemon citrus notes, with an intriguing struck-match character taking up the rear. On the palate, the acidity is prominent but in check, and the slightly chalky texture is appealing. When it comes to flavor, however, it loses much of what the nose offers, finishing a little flat and bitter."
"This is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. The wine takes an herbal path rather than putting the emphasis on juicy fruit. A phenolic edge frames the finish. Balanced and detailed, it would make a fine accompaniment to herb-grilled chicken."

"Very flavorful and full-bodied but also velvety-smooth in texture, this wine is packed with ripe black plum, cranberry and dark chocolate flavors. It has plenty of tannin to thicken the texture but low acidity, which lends softness."

"This stainless steel-aged wine shows confected, marshmallow-like notes before its high-toned, stony minerality comes through. Peach and citrus flavors form the fruit foundation, which is creamy in texture."
"This wine strikes a balance between crispness and fullness as it offers tart green apple aromas, richer, riper apple and Bosc pear flavors and a texture that's more rounded than sharp."
"A fennel note is prominent on the nose of this silky smooth and voluptuous white. Caramel-topped apple pie richness gives it an appealing personality, brightened by a lemon rind note on the finish."
"What herbal berry aromas this wine has evaporate fast, replaced by oaky clove and other spice notes. Iron tight and tannic, the wine draws on the cheeks. Spiced-up plum flavors set up a rugged finish with hard tannins and spicy berry residuals. Serve with beef or BBQ; it needs it."

"Swirls of char, smoke and vanilla envelop plush blackberry and plum notes on this perfumed blend of Pinot Noir, Dornfelder, Regent and Pinot Madelaine grapes. It's juicy and concentrated yet maintains a freshness of acidity and herbaceousness. Fine-grained, pert tannins lend a bit of edge to this approachable, enjoyable wine."
"This is one of a pair of premium off-dry Champagnes that are distinctive and bold. There is a tannic edge to this wine as well as plenty of red fruitiness and acidity. Because it is only just off dry, it will make a great pairing with savory spicy dishes."
"A lively mousse gives this wine an immediately ebullient character. Add to that the soft raspberry flavors, and the wine is a real charmer. Fruity and ripe, it is balanced with just the right acidity to support the fine fruitiness. Drink now."

The palate bumps the style up a notch, with powerful tannins and plenty of acidity. Perhaps the more intriguing element to this Pinot is the finish: Tart cranberry and floral tones are long and lingering."
"Tangy and varietal, this emphasizes some pleasing grassiness, with a touch of petrol in the nose. The fresh, herbal components are set against a mix of lemon, grapefruit and pineapple fruits."

"A blend of Pinot Blanc and four other white grapes, this pleasant and fruity wine offers simple enjoyment. Peach, pink-grapefruit, straw and cracker flavors show on the palate and lead to a dry finish."
"A softly unfussy wine with moderate acidity, this is rounded and light-bodied, with rose petal and red cherry aromas. The oak is subtle and supportive."
"Rose aromas emerge on the nose of this block-designated, light-bodied wine. It's full of crisp red fruit and bright acidity."

"Dominated by Pinot Meunier, this soft rich wine is immediately accessible. It has apple and crisp pear fruits along with a dry crisp texture. The nonvintage Champagne from this producer is attractive, fruity and dry at the end."
"A white wine made from a red grape, this barely hints at a tawny straw shade. The fruit tastes principally of golden apple and white peach, and it has a pleasing roundness in the mouth, with a light touch of saltine cracker."
"Barrel influences takes over aromatically, with notes of wood, toast and dark chocolate in front of golden raisins, with the fruit seeming somewhat dried out. The palate brings tart cranberry and cherry flavors that show a sense of liveliness. Good things are going on but the aromas and palate seem a bit disconnected at present."
"This is a superrich and ripe wine that many will find over the top, but it will certainly wow those looking for extreme concentration. Prune, black currant, blueberry and caramel aromas lead into a thick and raisiny palate of chocolate, baked fruit, gingerbread and coffee syrup flavors."
"A rich yellow color and intensely woody aromas of sawmill smoke and barrel spice lead to a fleshy, full and oily palate. This wine tastes heavily of oak and related resin. The fruit character is not a big factor on either the palate or the finish."
"Aromas of forest floor, cassis and blackberry are solid, smooth and inviting. In the mouth, this wine shows penetrating acidity and controlled sharpness. Flavors of cherry, plum and mixed berries are propelled by acidity, and that's also how this ends."
"This is an opulent, showy style of a sparkling wine. Notes of honey, brioche, dates and ginger lead to a rich, round texture and vigorous mousse. The finish is a little mealy and sweet but there are plenty who will dig this rich style, particularly once they see the affordable price tag."
"This small-production, nouveau-style wine was made without oak or filtering. Simple and juicy, it's festive, with effusive dried cranberry and cola spice notes that are soft and easygoing."
"Hawthorn, peach blossom and exotic fruit aromas take center stage. The rich vibrant palate doles out banana, melon, white peach and candied lemon drop. A foaming mousse provides softness while bright acidity refreshes the finish."
"Complex blackberry, black plum, white pepper, wet slate and sagebrush aromas lead into a palate of dried berry, gravel and tar flavors. Its bountiful fruit character is offset by a background of dried oregano and thyme notes."
"Bold and very ripe in flavor, but also soft in texture, this wine is packed with blackberry, boysenberry and fig notes. It seems slightly sweet on the palate and finishes with a jammy touch. While full-bodied, it's smooth and easy to sip."
Tropical fruit flavors are brightened by lemon-lime citrus notes and a hint of the variety's trademark grassiness. A slippery smooth texture and balanced acidity make this easy to drink on its own.
"Clean, fresh and uncomplicated is the best way to describe the nose on this crisp, citrusy Cava. Flavors of green apple, white grapes and citrus fruits finish with ease and clarity."
"Only just off dry, this finely balanced wine is tangy, zesty and rich. Its white-fruit flavors and touch of zingy lime are infectious and immediately attractive. Enjoy this stylish wine with Asian food."
"A touch of ripe pear plays into the Golden Delicious notes of the nose. The palate displays the same fruit flavors on its very light and easy fruit-driven palate, supported by freshness and fizzing froth. The lemony finish is dry and refreshing."
"Balanced and fruity with its hints of red fruits, this is a light wine. The dominance of the two Pinot grapes gives it a slight texture and tannic edge although this is smoothed out by the soft finish from the relatively high dosage. Ready to drink now."
"Based in the small Szanne vineyard region south of Epernay, this producer's nonvintage cuve is dominated by Chardonnay. It reflects the house style: crisp, steely with a good balance between acidity and citrus and apple fruitiness. Drink this refreshing Champagne now."
This is a crisp and dry Champagne. Its attractive red fruits are linked to the acidity and tight texture to give a linear wine that is refreshing and has a bright aftertaste. Drink now.
"A light earthy aroma and enjoyable savory flavors suggesting dried herbs, bouillon and canteloupe characterize this deceptively full-bodied, dry wine. It has a nervy, crisp texture, great acidity and intriguing complexity."
"This is still pretty stiff and tight through the midpalate, with fruit ranging from cranberry to raspberry and sour cherry. Tannins leave a slightly green impression; the wine doesn't seem ripe and full flavored. Some extra bottle age might improve it. Drink 2020 to 2024."
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, citrus peel and a whiff of chopped dill. The aromas carry over to the round full-bodied palate along with yellow apple and a hint of ginger while a saline note lifts the close."
"The notes weaves a tapestry of peach, butter, grass, peas and citrus followed by a palate that's all about the texture. With balanced acidity and a chalky mouthfeel propping up flavors of lemon and green herbs, this is a complex and food-friendly offering."
"Expansive, long and tannic, this wine is robust and powerfully concentrated, the flavors a mixture of tart cranberry, raspberry and black tea."
"The familiar Cordon Rouge, in an impressively restyled bottle, is soft, fruity and eminently drinkable. Its balance comes from the ripe apple fruit and the underlying softness of the creamy mousse. Acidity ties it all together. Drink this bottling now."
"Ripe black cherry, roasted meat, wet stone and caramel notes show on the nose of this bottling of a grape rarely seen in this region. It's slightly sweet on the palate, with ripe blueberry and cocoa flavors, but compelling for its novelty."
"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth."
"This is a fruity wine, gentle with its white fruits and citrus flavors. It has just a touch of minerality from the granite soil that brings out acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now."
"Creamy and refined, this offers aromas of fragrant wild flower, spring blossom and white stone fruit. The silky palate doles out white peach, yellow apple and candied lemon drop alongside a foaming mousse and fresh acidity."
Reductive oak betrays this wine's light-bodied take on the appellation. Its waxy green apple flavor and bright acidity are deftly wrapped in toastiness.
"This stiffens up with streaks of stem and herb, underscoring compact blueberry and blue-plum fruits. It's an eight vineyard mix, aged in 20% new French oak."
"Citrus, ripe apple, guava and pineapple soda aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a winery that has explored white Alsatian grapes since the early 1980s. It tightens up considerably on the palate, where Asian pear and lemon skin flavors make for a mellow expression."
"Produced by the Baron family, this nonvintage blend is soft and as balanced as the other wines in the range. It has a ripe feel to it, creamed apple and green plums giving the fruity element. Drink this attractive wine now."
"Cinnamon is prominent on the nose of this wine, while bright berry, cherry, black olive and floral notes linger in the background. The acidity is a little slow to arrive on the palate but when it does it mingles seamlessly with fine grained tannins. The midpalate is a little flat but the fruit creeps back in at the end."
"Tropical-fruit aromas of lychee and passion fruit come with a hint of lanolin. This wine feels citrusy, with fresh passion fruit and tangerine flavors that are not oily or gritty on the finish."
"Soft and creamy, this floral wine also has an attractive touch of toastiness suggesting it has bottle age. Its green-plum and citrus flavors contribute to the crispness of this balanced wine. Drink now."
"Coming from the winery's estate vineyard high up in Upper Mill Creek, this wine is starting to show a bit of age, offering aromas of anise, dried cherry, green pepper and cigar ash. Equal parts dark and green, the flavors come off a bit disjointed, with bell-pepper notes on the finish."
Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend savory complexity to sunny tangerine and honey on the palate of this kabinett. It's not a deeply penetrating wine but delicate tangerine sweetness and zippy acidity feel vital and fresh. Drink now.
"Lively and fresh, this off-dry wine doles out ripe green apple, candied lemon slice and peach flavors alongside a frothy mousse. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors."
"There's a cotton candy aroma on the nose of this bottling that builds toward tropical fruit scents, such as guava, papaya and cherimoya. Apple pie, mango and coconut cream notes cling to a steely line of structure, feeling clean and crisp on the palate. A pop of bubblegum shows on the finish."
"This wine's oaky entry derives from 10 months aging in French and American oak. It's creamy and voluptuous in style, with simple flavors of apple and a moderately long finish."
"This wine is soft and on the sweet end of the Brut spectrum. It is packed with red fruits, but its light on the acidity and finishes with a gentle ripe aftertaste. It would be delicious as an apritif Champagne."
"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are a bit fiery. This Malbec is tightly wound, with rubbery tannins and more than enough acidity. Spiced plum and berry flavors give way to a bold, forward finish with herbal, savory notes."
"Aromas of pring flower, gold apple and Anjou pear lead into the crisp refreshing palate along with a hint of nectarine. Tart acidity gives it a bright, juicy finish."
"Boldly etched with milk chocolate and baked plum notes, this wine is ripe, robust and jammy in spirit. Leather, black pepper and cinnamon accents season it nicely."
"Fermented and aged entirely in stainless steel, this wine is dominated by tropical fruit, swimming in pineapple and banana aromas and flavors. Unfettered by oak, it boasts sizzling acidity and, while tasty, is somewhat one-dimensional."
"Berry aromas with subtle spice accents are damp and soothing. In the mouth, this is the opposite: All dry tannins and rawness. Hard-driving black-fruit flavors pull up short on a peppery finish. It's an honest but rough wine."
Oily aromas of peanut and burnt match ride high on the nose of this plump and pulpy tropical-leaning white. Typical lychee and honeydew flavors are slightly bitter in front of a fleshy palate with moderate acidity.
"This snappy blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Smillon and Muscat brings a pungent, somewhat grassy profile front and center. Stone fruits with a touch of lime fill in the core, with some bite to the finish."
"Clean white-fruit aromas include a note of pastry. This brut is tight and crisp on the palate, with flavors of green apple, lime and green herb that lead to a fresh finish."
"Meaty and substantial on the palate, this wine comes from several vineyard sites and was fermented in stainless steel tanks. It has a juicy note of sweet, ripe red fruit that's inviting."
"The standard nonvintage blend from this producer is soft with a good touch of bottle age as well as a relatively high dosage. It is fruity, easy and with its final acidity, crisp and refreshing to drink."
"Aromas of bread crust and lime follow over to the lean bone-dry palate along with a suggestion of pear. It's lightly sparkling and crisp, with some brisk acidity."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Syrah, this offers high-toned aromas, with notes of green herb, cocoa and green pepper. The palate is chalky in feel, with the tannins seeming bunched up and dry. Cocoa notes linger on the finish. The greenness on the aromas is hard to get around."
"NEXT is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. This blends grapes from southern Oregon and the Willamette Valley, putting a pleasing toasty character around the light red fruit. A streak of burnt coffee suggests that the barrel influence is still being integrated."
"This was barrel fermented in neutral oak, and not put through malolactic fermentation. A mix of apple, white peach and green-melon fruit opens up the core flavors, then it seems to stop short. The feeling of being attenuated may simply reflect the youth of the wine, or a need for further bottle age. Drink 2019 to 2025."
"While this is certainly a young fruity wine, it also has a soft texture to go with the juicy black fruits to make it ready to drink now. It is smoky, lightly tannic and packed full of ripe fruits."
"This small-production wine is lightly spiced, robust and herbal. Dense and powerful wild strawberry and earth notes give it a sense of place."
"Refreshing, fun and refined, this crowd-pleasing sparkler offers ripe Bartlett pear, green apple and a hint of nectarine drop. Crisp acidity and a lively perlage give it a vibrant edge."
"Aromas of ripe apple, sliced pear and white flowers lead to tart, lighter-side-of-medium-bodied fruit flavors. Spices notes fill out the finish. It delivers easy-drinking enjoyment and is very varietal."
"This wine is marked as sec (dry) and it is certainly that. The acidity is intense, cutting through the apple fruits and almond flavors. The wine obviously needs to soften and mature for a few months, so drink from 2018."
"There is a touch of lemon cheesecake on the noseboth creamy and zesty. The palate seems translucent in its lightness with its fizzing froth. The finish is clean, refreshing and dry. Drink soon."
"The cocoa, vanilla and black fruit are followed by a chocolaty, wood-forward palate that shows a bit of volatility. There are some good things going on but the oak (30% new French and American) seems to get in the way, making the varietal a bit hard to find."
"With grapes coming from the Marne Valley, this wine is rich with ripe grapes. At the same time, it has a balance with an acidity and soft aftertaste that makes it immediately drinkable."
"Rose and turned earth notes mark the entry of this concentrated, tannic wine. Robust strawberry and black cherry flavors fill it out, wrapped in toasted oak."
"Deep-amber colored, this orange wine has aromas of sunbaked earth, brimstone, overripe orange zest and pressed wild flower. The lean but lively palate offers dried nectarine slices, toasted almond and a hint of dried apricot alongside bright acidity. A salty note closes the finish. While lovers of orange wine might embrace this, it's definitely not for everyone."
"This wine, blending one-third each of the three main Champagne grapes, is crisp, although with a dosage that gives it a soft edge. Full of ripe apple and warm melon fruit, it has acidity as well as a gentle texture. The wine is balanced and ready to drink."
"A straightforward example of Central Otago Pinot Noir, this shows notes of dark cherry, brambly fruit and mocha, accompany powerful yet fine grained tannins and balanced acidity. Oak spice and a slightly savory quality meet on the finish. Drink now."
"Ripe berries and oak spice dominate on this Pinot Noir from the bottom of New Zealand's North Island. The palate follows with balanced acidity and silky tannins but the oaky characters dominate all the way through, finishing on the bitter side."
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up two-thirds of this wine, with the balance Malbec and Syrah. Vibrant aromas of plum, spice and herb are followed by plush, lightly sweet, palate-coating fruit flavors backed by grainy tannins. It finishes sweet, delivering plenty of easy-drinking appeal."
"Tropical fruit aromas show up on the ripe fruity palate of this wine. With pineapple and mango, it is in the tropical spectrum of Sauvignon Blanc. The acidity is just right to keep the crisp texture in place. Drink now."
"This offers clean, clear blackberry fruit, along with pretty baking spices. No details of barrel aging were provided, but some toasty flavors are there and well integrated. The acids, however, leave a chalky aftertaste."
"Thoughts of Black Forest cake, cherry chocolate brownies, and baked plums are immediately conjured upon smelling this Pinot Noir from one of New Zealand's largest producers. Violets, dusty books, and cola are in the mix too. The palate promises more of the same, with silky tannins and balanced acidity. It's on the rich side, but is an undeniable crowd pleaser."
"Made by the saigne process, where the juice is bled from the principal ferment to concentrate the Pinot Noir, this ros is blocky and simple. Light flavors of strawberry and cherry are finished dry and fade quickly. Drink this well chilled before the next vintage appears."
"A tinge of lime pith lends nuance to this straightforward yet refreshingly citrusy Riesling. Just a shade off dry, its delicate sweetness is balanced neatly by cutting acidity and a spry, zesty mouthfeel. Enjoy now for its freshness."
"Honeysuckle and exotic fruit aromas leap from the glass while the somewhat sweet palate offers banana, white peach and a confectionery note of candied lemon slice. It's easygoing, with a frothy mousse."
"This wine starts off with a broad blend of berries and cherries, and well-integrated, smooth tannins. But in the finish and aftertaste, a chemical bitterness emerges and persists."
"Aromas of plum, stewed cherry, milk chocolate and vanilla are accented by notes of smoke. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, with fruit winning out on the finish that narrows a bit."
"Aromas of spice, macerated cherry, vanilla and blackberry lead to jammy, sweet-seeming fruit flavors. It provides easy-drinking appeal, with grainy tannins backing it all up."
"Funky green aromas ride high atop stewed plum, cardamom and coffee grounds. This wine feels saturated and jammy, as if it were spreadable. Herbal berry and juniper flavors are borderline weedy, and it tastes green on the finish."
"Aromas bring notes of beeswax, lees and lemon. The palate is medium bodied and creamy in feel, backed by zippy acidity. The variety isn't entirely distinct but, despite this, it delivers appeal."
"Scents of yellow stone fruit and white spring flower mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers crisp apple, yellow peach and citrus drop framed in firm acidity and a lively perlage."
"Characteristic lime-leaf and lemon notes marry with blossoms and grass. The palate, however, is less focused, starting bright, tapering to flatness in the middle, and finishing on the richer side."
"Sliced apple aromas and crisp pear and citrus flavors are the hallmarks of this attractive, balanced wine. It is a perfumed wine, floral and with a streak of tight acidity as a contrast. Drink now."
"The nonvintage blend from this venerable producer is as balanced as all its Champagnes. It steers a fine course between acidity and crispness and a softer riper dosage. Blended with equal parts of all three main Champagne grapes, it is ready to drink."
"This Pinot takes a few minutes to open up, yet when it does it smells like dusting polish and Dr. Pepper. The palate is more subtle with a good lick of acidity and chewy tannins finishing on dark cherry fruit. It's not the most typical example of this region or grape variety, but it has its charms nonetheless."
"Nutty, with a note of baked lemon, this affordable, approachable wine is robust in tropical ripeness yet retains enough acidity to remain fresh and fruity throughout."
"Juicy, sun-kissed citrus and stone fruit flavors are straightforward yet concentrated here. Medium-sweet and delicately framed, it's a forward, fruity wine balanced by ample lemon and tangerine acidity. Drink now."
"A blend that aromatically is dominated by herbal Sauvignon Blanc, this is a crisp wine that is fruity, easy and accessible. Its acidity and citrus flavors are bright, lively and ready to drink."
This invigorating sparkler opens with heady aromas of white peach and spring wild flower while the enjoyable palate offers green apple and candied lemon drop. Tangy acidity gives it a crisp finish.
"This everyday drinker leads with concentrated but mellow aromas of black plum, turned earth, anise and sweet mint. It's quite full on the palate, with baked red fruit and baking spice flavors. Very fruit-forward."
"Apple, honeydew and yeast aromas introduce this perennially consistent brut. A crisp, citrusy mouthfeel and clean nectarine and orange flavors finish with a zip."
"Honeysuckle and tropical fruit aromas lead the nose while the vivacious palate offers honeydew melon, white peach and pineapple. Crisp acidity and a lively perlage invigorate the finish."
Pretty scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit rise from the glass. The off-dry refreshing palate offers sweet white peach and candied citrus peel alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.
"This soft wine is gentle, rounded and immediately accessible. Its lightly crisp acidity shows in the lemon fruitiness and in a zingy texture. The wine is ready to drink."
"Savory, grapy aromas include gamy notes and an herbal influence. A choppy, abrupt palate is gravelly in feel. Herbal plum and cranberry flavors are meaty and a touch green on the finish. For a Malbec that's not just about black fruits and oak, give this a shot."
"Thickly concentrated in a rich style, this wine also possesses a balanced backbone of citrus and melon flavor, made more decadent by accompanying marshmallow and vanilla bean notes."
"Concentrated cassis and black plum aromas meet pepper, tar and pressed violet notes on the nose of this bottling. The well-structured palate is fresh and floral, with peppery spice, tart blackberry flavors and sticky tannins, but is very reserved at this stage of its life."
"This is a fat style of ros, bringing out ripe strawberries and diminishing the acidity. That makes it attractive as an apritif style. It is fruity and soft with a smooth aftertaste."
"Aromas of yellow apple and a yeasty whiff of bread crust lead the nose on this lightly sparkling, bottle-fermented wine. The aromas carry over to the crisp straightforward palate along with lime, a hint of almond and racy acidity."
"This is a bright lemon-yellow color, with plenty of citrus-rind flavors. The dominant fruit is grapefruit, and the wine is finished bone dry."
"Raisiny aromas are accompanied by a chocolate note on the nose. This Garnacha is rough and punchy on the palate, with tart currant and plum flavors that run counter to the nose. Prior to an abrasive but energetic finish, this tastes herbal and oaky."
"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating."
"Aromas of fragrant spring flower, white peach and a whiff of banana take center stage. Reflecting the nose, the bright palate offers golden apple and hint of candied citrus drop alongside fresh acidity."
"Aromas seem a bit locked up, with notes of plum, herb and cedar. The raspberry flavors similarly seem bunched up, with lightly dry tannins providing support. Vanilla flavors linger on the finish. The variety gets a bit lost."
"Saline-based aromas suggest sea shells, accompanied by notes of vanilla and stone fruits. This wine has a lively yet full palate that fits the Tupungato style. A layer of oak flavor sits atop pineapple, melon and peach notes. It's woody and tastes of honeyed tropical fruits on the finish."
"This opens with aromas of ripe orchard fruit and pressed acacia flower. Made with organically grown grapes, the off-dry palate shows candied nectarine drop and mature yellow apple alongside bright acidity."
"Early aromas of sea shell and chalk dust transition first to apricot and mango and later to wood grain. This wine feels plump but dilute, with moderate intensity and depth. Flavors of tropical fruits, banana and dry oak evaporate on the finish into undefined mildness."
"Floral aromas of wisteria and jasmine mingle with ripe orchard fruit. On the palate, bright acidity lifts white peach, ripe pear and candied lemon drop. A silky mousse adds softness."
"A bitter herbal edge frames this young wine that remains tight and unexpressive, even after many hours. Aged in 28% new French oak for 16 months, it may be showing significant bottle shock at this time. The finish is short, hard and slightly bitter."
"Waxy lemon, green veg, honey and a bit of matchstick lead precede a chalky textured palate. Searing acidity keeps the body light in feel."
"Favoring a more tropical spectrum, this wine offers aromas of pineapple and white flowers with some lemon and a touch of grass. The palate comes with a little weight alongside a nice lick of acidity and a long pineapple and citrus finish."
"Aromas of beeswax, pressed flower and yellow stone fruit take center stage. The off-dry silky palate doles out mature pear, yellow apple and candied nectarine zest framed in a soft mousse. It closes on a pleasantly bitter note."
"This Bordeaux-style blend comprises 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and a splash each of Malbec and Petit Verdot. The massive tannins dominate, to the detriment of balance and fruit. Perhaps those tannins will mellow with ample age, but that's a ways off. Right now it offers hints of plum and cherry, a dash of mocha, and a lot of stem and earthy tannins."
"This powerful blend of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is smoky with oak and thickly concentrated on the palate, with sweet blueberry fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Round and rich, it has moderate acidity."
"This fairly limited production, single-vineyard effort was barrel fermented, and shows aromatic notes of popcorn, toast and grassy citrus. The fruit mixes oranges and apples, and the wine has a nice balance with ample acidity."
"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors."
"White spring flower and apple aromas lift out of the glass. On the palate, bracing acidity and brisk bubbles offset ripe pear and a hint of thyme."
"Aromas of ripe pear, yellow apple and a hint of almond follow over to the linear bone-dry palate. It's exceedingly fresh, with brisk acidity and a vigorous perlage."
"A small portion of this wine (10%) is barrel fermented, which seems to slightly soften and round out the feel. Fleshy pear and apple comes with a hint of honey on the palate."
"Bright and crisp, this bright sparkler has aromas of lime and apple that follow through to the lively palate. Vibrant acidity gives it a refreshing finish."
"Pressed acacia flower, orchard fruit and yeasty bread-dough aromas waft out of the glass. On the lean racy palate, tangy acidity underscores yellow apple, tangerine and bitter almond before a crisp close."
"This soft sparkler offers sensations of green apple, white peach and a hint of lemon drop. Bright acidity gives it a refreshing finish."
"Crisp and with plenty of acidity, this fruity wine with its white stone-fruit aromas is balanced between a sweeter edge and a mineral texture. It is lively, fruity with apples and spice and ready to drink."
"With the fruit from equal parts The Benches and Canoe Ridge Vineyard, the addition of Syrah (9%) stands out on the aromas, with its notes of plum followed by vanilla and licorice. The palate is lightly sweet, with bunched-up tannins."
"Just off dry, the wine has retained crisp acidity as well as ripe apple and spice flavors. It is a rounded wine, rich with a touch of almonds as well as pear and a final tang of acidity. Drink now."
"Unmistakably a Kiwi Pinot Noir, with notes of Dr. Pepper, ripe bramble fruit, oaky spices and tree bark, it loses it's way a little on the palate, lacking the juicy fruit to stand up to all the oak."
"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apritif."
"Grassy, floral and herbal, this nice white comes from a well-regarded site devoted to the variety. Melon and fuzzy peach flavors highlight its dry, diluted palate, with moderate acidity."
"Deeply gold-colored, this opens with aromas of oak, bread crust and toasted nut. The scents carry over to the lean palate along with hints of overripe orange peel, a suggestion of dried apricot and a dollop of vanilla. Drink now to capture the remaining fruit and freshness."
"This pale-colored ros comes from a producer based in the Aube region. The wine is smooth, raspberry flavored and with a light tang of acidity. The wine is fruity, with a strong sense of the structure and flavor of the wine used to give color. Drink now."
"A very shy nose leads onto a fresh palate where frothy bubbles reveal a hint of tart red-currant fruit and fresh citrus. The body is very light and dry, but has a zesty, mouthwatering finish."
"A very subdued nose leads to a fresh, lively and light palate that displays subtle red-currant fruit. Freshness makes this appetizing while the finish is dry and refreshing."
"This is a light wine, full of citrus and crisp green-apple flavors. Behind this fruitiness, there is a creamy texture as well as intense tight acidity. The wine is bright, delicious to drink young."
"This new offering combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from the mountain site. The wine is intensely ripe and tart, with rounded edges and an oaky underbelly. Cedar and black currant are the dominant characteristics."
Aromas of melon and mango give a good indication of this tropical-fruit-flavored wine. Its acidity and light herbal character are just foils to this bold forward fruitiness. It is an intense wine ready to drink.
"Aromas and flavors of green apple, pear and a hint of citrus drop come together on this bright easygoing sparkler. Lively acidity keeps it fresh."
"An ebullient mousse gives this wine a creamy texture. The wine, which is soft and rounded, is cut with acidity to give a crisp edge to the fruitiness. With its relatively high dosage, this is probably best as an apritif."
"This Merlot-driven blend also includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, the grapes grown on upper bench blocks of the producer's estate. It's simple, offering red cherry, currant and cedar flavors, with firm, persistent tannins and a ripe, round mouthfeel."
"Raw, scratchy cherry and plum aromas are dusty and lightly herbaceous. A full, blocky, chewy palate deals roasted plum and currant flavors. On the finish, this wine tastes smoky, with a note of grilled meat."
"This Bordeaux-style red blend, made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, opens with pleasant herbal tones of green pepper, blackcurrant leaf, plum skin and tobacco leaf. Black fruit flavors abound on the solidly structured palate, finishing with hits of milk chocolate and charred earth."
"A selection from 55-year-old vines, this is soft, with plenty of juicy acidity to add balance. It is a rounded fruity wine, full of lemon and grapefruit flavors that are spiced with pepper. Drink this light, bright wine now."
"Very fruity in flavor and tangy in mouthfeel, this full-bodied wine combines lively acidity with citrus, herb and ripe pear flavors and a touch of sweetness. Little or no oak influence comes through, so the vivid fruit components take center stage."
"A touch of honey and nettle plays on the nose. The frothy, fizzing palate delivers off-dry fruit notes of yellow pear and ripe citrus. Light and fresh, the body finishes just about dry. Drink soon."
"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip."
"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit."
"Vibrant aromas of cantaloupe, freshly cut pear and yellow apple are at the fore. While the palate is bone dry, it has a light spritz that seems out of place. It's a shame as aromatically it delivers a lot of enjoyment."
This is a soft slightly sweet wine (dry in Champagne means sweeter than Brut) with red-berry fruits and balanced acidity. It has a ripe full rich aftertaste. Drink now.
"Nicely balanced and fairly fruity, this wine is easy to like for its crisp apple and grapefruit aromas, fresh and ripe flavors and smooth and lively texture."
"Pear, cooked apple and citrus notes show on the nose of this bottling from the Alsace-inspired winery in the heart of Edna Valley. The palate veers dry, with sour orange and more cooked apple flavors."
"Just a single barrel of this wine was produced. Although it's a 2016, the wine is a straw gold and seems well on the way to maturity. Ripe and tangy apples and pears abound, with a squirt of lemon juice. Drink now through 2018."
"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up."
"Bright fruit flavors light up this tart, medium-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries and red cherries, tastes crisp and bright and has a light nip of cranberry-like astringency."
"Honeysuckle and orchard-fruit aromas lead the nose while the bright enjoyable palate offers ripe pear, green apple and candied citrus peel. It's easygoing, with fresh acidity and soft continuous bubbles."
"Soft and slightly sweet, this straightforward sparkler offers green apple, white peach and candied-citrus-peel flavors. It's bright, with tangy acidity."
"This wine is a little green out of the gate, with notes of garden herbs and green flowers along with macerated cranberries and ripe blue fruit. The palate has a pleasing texture and sense of purity but ultimately the aromas are too distracting."
"This dark red sparkling wine made from Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier smells like Dr. Pepper, has lively bubbles and leaves a dry, very fruity impression on the palate. Dark cherry and ripe plum flavors dominate."
"Aromas of spring wildflower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the foaming, off-dry palate doles out creamy yellow pear and candied citrus peel. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors."
"Bright red plum fruit is underscored by strong herbal aromas in this widely available bottling. It's fruity on the palate, with a green pepper edge that grows minty as it approaches the finish. A great, refreshing style of Cabernet for barbecues."
"Aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and herb are at the fore, with a green note lurking in the background. The barrel flavors are out front on the palate as well, with the tannins seeming a bit gritty and dry. It's a bit hard to discern the variety."
"Aromas bring notes of white flowers, candlewax and summer squash, showing no overt new-oak influence. The palate is medium bodied, delivering easy-drinking appeal."
"The aromas on this wine seem a bit candied, with notes of red currant, raspberry and cranberry. Flavors are fresh, with plenty of tart, puckering cranberry notes throughout. There's not a lot of complexity, but it should fit in well at the dinner table, with the oak dialed way back and the acid up."
"This includes 13% Gamay in the blend and spent 13 months in 15% new French oak. It's a modest wine, with cranberry and tart raspberry fruit. It has good focus, a dash of pepper and more substance to the finish than you might expect. Two-hundred cases were exported to the U.S."
Aromas of stewed black fruits and compost are leafy and a touch green. This has a wide-bodied mouthfeel and grabby tannins. Medicinal plum and berry flavors taste minty and herbal on the finish.

"Terpenes and other gritty aromas control a nose that's fresh but short on fruit. This blend of 85% Torronts and 15% Riesling is made more vital by angular citric acidity. Mildly pyrazinic green flavors are offset by passion fruit and lychee notes prior to a crisp, racy finish."

"This is a ripe, oaky wine from Waipara, just north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island. Pineapple, mango and honey characters dominate on the nose. The palate is rich and on the flabby side, the oak overpowering much of the fruit, but those who like their powerfully oaked whites will dig this version."

"A black-fruit nose with cola notes and earthiness is about as easy as this high-acid Cabernet-Malbec blend gets. In the mouth, it's tartaric and screechy. Grapy berry flavors seem rough due to the high-acid content, and the finish is hard and edgy. All that said, it has good flavors and aromas, but falls down in the mouthfeel."

"This opens with pretty scents of spring blossom and white stone fruit while the lively foaming palate doles out green apple and lemon drop. It's fresh, with bright acidity."

"A rich texture and good, fruity flavors make this light-bodied, low-alcohol wine easy to enjoy. Apple and white peach aromas meet apple flavors and a soft mouthfeel."

"The aromas bring notes of vanilla, green pepper, black tea, cherry and herb, and the palate delivers much the same. This wine comes off as a bit innocuous but is quite consistent throughout. It tapers on the finish."
"This is an unusual blend of principally Syrah, Malbec, Tempranillo and Souzao, along with bits of Petit Verdot, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of cocoa, vanilla and green herb lead to tart cherry flavors that seem underripe. The finish comes up short."

"This wine has a grassy element that won't appeal to all palates, complemented by medium body and citrus, wet stone and peach fuzz flavor. Neutral oak aging keeps it fresh and lively."
"A reductive nose distracts from the dusty oak, vanilla and robust peach and papaya notes in this food-friendly, round and approachable wine."
"This young wine has tart, rather thin fruit flavors of pomegranate and wild berry. There's ample aciditymaybe too ample for some tasters. Flavors seems to fall off and fade quickly."
"Piercing green aromas are far out front, distracting from the notes of cherry and herb. The cherry flavors seem a bit attenuated."

"A nose with oxidized baked-fruit aromas confirms that this 2008 is on the back side of its run. A jammy, reduced palate houses squeaky tannins and leads to a flavor profile ruled by raisiny, stewed berry fruits. Prune and baking-spice flavors control a soft, mature finish."

"Opening with subtle aromas of white flower, this lively straightforward sparkler doles out yellow apple and citrus zest. Crisp acidity gives it a refreshing finish."

"Here's a crisp, no-frills sparkler that offers yellow apple and pear flavors. It's invigorating, with brisk acidity and vivacious bubbles."
"This wine starts broody and dusty, with dark cherry, mocha, and woody notes. The palate feels a little hot and at the moment the tannins are huge, tightly wound, and overpowering. The pretty cherry notes are eventually revealed again with time in the glass."
"This is a spicy peppery wine, its acidity tempered by the tangy texture and bitter almond flavors. Drink this attractive wine now."
"Melon aromas are a touch mealy and suggest cantaloupe that's past its peak. A foamy palate is coarse, while tastes of burnt orange and red plum. On the finish, this dissipates quickly."
"Fun and quenching, this crisp, informal sparkler delivers ripe green apple and pear flavors. Vibrant acidity gives it a clean finish."
"Smoky and meaty, with decadent bacon notes, this wine is hugely built and concentrated, its black fruit deeply etched with cigar box and clove accents."
"Aromas of melon, mango and papaya are more yeasty than fresh and alert. This Trepat-based ros feels foamy and soda-like. Flavors of citrus, melon and brown sugar finish slightly flat but fruity."
"Vanillan oak notes dominate on this Pinot Noir, originating from Nelson, on the northwest of New Zealand's South Island. Red berry, licorice, and savory olive characters follow, along with chunky tannins and lashings of acidity. Stylistically this is a broody, oaky, powerful expression of Pinot and one that will need food or a few years in bottle for the oak to mellow out. Drink now2022."
"This shows a good amount of funk with its matchstick, mushroom and toast aromas. There's a speckle of lime leaf and grass to remind you that this is Sauvignon Blanc, after all, but mostly it is its own beast entirely. Oily yet grainy in texture with a whiff of smoke on the finish, there's just enough acid to keep you going back for more."
"This late-harvest wine was frozen cryogenically and aged in neutral casks prior to bottling. It's mid-level sweet, with much higher alcohol than most such efforts. Candied pears come to mind, with residual phenolic bitterness in the finish."
"This wine shows reductive notes initially, requiring aeration to burn off the aromas. The palate is sharp-toned, with simple flavors of apple, making it perfect for simple enjoyment."
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually yields subdued whiffs of toasted oak and honey. On the shy palate, suggestions of mature apple, lemon drop and a briny note come through before a rather abrupt finish."

"Ripe and softly smooth, this simple, affordable wine is robust with toasty oak, coconut, cocoa and baked plum notes."
"The aromas bring light notes of corn husk and apple. This wine is broad in feel, with a lightly creamy texture full of roasted-corn flavors."

Fragrant raspberries are the attraction of this ripe medium-sweet and fruity wine. It has acidity and a crisp edge to balance the sugary fruitiness. Drink now.

"This light simple sparkler offers aromas and flavors of apple, pear and candied citrus zest. Bright acidity refreshes the finish."
"This simple style of Marlborough Pinot delivers notes of bramble berry, licorice and cola on the nose, with a slightly more complex palate of dark cherry, mocha spice and dried leaves. The oak is a little prevalent throughout and texturally it's on the lean and mean side, but the fruit carries through until the end, keeping the gluggability factor up."
"This soft simple Chardonnay is all fruit. Ripe pear and melon flavors are the order of the day here, giving a rounded wine with just the right amount of acidity. Drink now."
"This wine is made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Zinfandel. It has edgy tomato leaf scents and moderate acidity, muddling concentrated black and red berry, clove and leather flavors."
"Simple and fresh, this informal sparkler has light aromas of citrus and apple. The aromas carry over to the crisp palate along with brisk bubbles."
"This light-pink Malbec smells dry, oaky and bereft of fruit. A plump palate feels a touch resiny from six months of American-oak aging, while this wine tastes vaguely of wood, vanilla, cherry Pixie stick and powdered sugar."
"This dry ros is perfumed with red-currant fruits. On the palate, the theme of crisp red fruits continues, with acidity, a touch of pepper and smokiness from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. Drink the wine, with its tight acidity at the end, now."
"Brambly berry and leather aromas are rustic. This Malbec is hard and acidic. Short, generic plum and berry flavors don't expand or improve on the finish."
"Stone fruit and honeysuckle aromas lead the nose while the simple off-dry palate doles out green apple, peach and candied citrus peel. It's fresh and informal, with bright acidity."
"Fun and informal, this extremely simple sparkler offers flavors of white peach, citrus and confectionery note. It's bright and foamy, with fresh acidity."
"Here's an informal off-dry sparkler offering suggestions of apple and pear. It's fresh and simple, with crisp acidity."
"The aromas seem a bit off, with volatile notes along with lees, orange peel and peach. The palate is lightly creamy but still somewhat lean in style, not able to hold all of the flavors together."
"Bay leaf and eucalyptus figure prominently on the nose and palate of this wine, making for an intensely earthy, herbal experience, peppered by forest-floor notes."
"Dominant oak notes impact this wine in both taste and aroma, providing caramel- and tropical vanilla-like sweetness. It offers anise and pineapple flavors within its light-bodied frame."
"This is a good, dry wine with moderate fruit flavors, a straightforward texture and medium body. It has mild lemon and apple notes in the aroma and on the palate."
"The Charmat process, rather than the Champagne method, is used here. It's a clean, light, generic sparkling wine, done as a brut. Use it as an all-purpose mixer for best effect."
"Not your average bottle of bubbles, this naturally fermented wine has a cloudy appearance, wild earthy aromas and lots of peachy, spicy, earthy flavors."
"Banana custard and charred marshmallow scents show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is similar, with charred brioche and cream pie flavors."
"Dried oregano and cedar aromas meet dark cherry and graphite notes on the nose of this bottling. The palate is light and somewhat thin, with herb, crushed rock and dark berry flavors, finishing on a caramel note."
This light soft wine is crisp and clean. It moves into the tropical-fruit spectrum of Sauvignon with its ripe mango and peach flavors. There is a fine tang of acidity to this easygoing wine. Drink now.

"This affordably priced county wine is simple in structure, showcasing clove, cedar and black currant flavors on the full-bodied, concentrated palate."
"Candied, oaky aromas of clove outmuscle foxy berry scents. This blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon is heavy, tannic and ultimately a bit overweight and flabby. Clove, wood spice and cooked berry flavors finish with baking spice and woody notes."
"The pungent aromas of grass, waxy lemon and canned corn on the nose are followed by more citrus and overripe melon on a palate. This is zippy and clean but finishes slightly bitter."
"Although the label says Brut, in fact this is a very dry ros. It has a bitter edge that is off-putting and it seems to have lost the fruit along with way. The wine also has weight with a tannic aftertastea strange beast."
This is a crisp and tangy wine. Its citrus fruit and mineral texture give it a bright tight character. It is packed with acidity and with refreshing juicy lime. Drink now.

"Briny citrus and petrol aromas are unusual for Macabeo. This basic white tastes like lemon-infused water. Yeasty, leesy white-fruit flavors are low on steam. Drink Now."
Aromas of white spring flower and citrus zest rise out of the glass while the palate offers ripe yellow apple and a note of candied lemon drop. Foaming bubbles provide a soft backdrop.
"Delicate scents of Rennet apple and Bartlett pear lead to the lively, somewhat lean palate. It's simple but also crisp and clean."

"Light in both alcohol and concentration, this seems to have a hint of residual sugar, perhaps intent on masking the acidity. It offers little indication of ripe fruit or varietal character. It's a dilute, plain, generic white wine."
Plump tropical fruit aromas show on the nose. A fruity but not complex palate deals short melon and tropical-fruit flavors prior to a briny finish.

This extremely simple off-dry sparkler has light floral scents and flavors of mature yellow apple and canned pineapple. Brisk acidity and vigorous bubbles offer an edgy backdrop.
"This wine feels flat, with no life to the palate. It's been fermented to complete dryness, leaving only tired skin flavors of dried lemon and mixed citrus. Two bottles were tasted, with identical results."

"Aromas of nut and yellow apple skin follow over to the lean palate along with brisk acidity. It's vigorous, with steely bubbles."
The wine has bitterness from the intense acidity and herbal character. That shows its youth and this intensity will calm down as the ripe fruit softens. It will be a perfumed wine with a softer texture from spring 2018.
"Smoky and earth tones persist from nose to finish here, obscuring fresh lemon and lime on the palate. While off dry in style, its a savory wine with a slightly bitter, waxy finish."

"This is a soft ripe wine. Its apple and crisp pear fruitiness is right up front, revealing a simple open light wine that has a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
"Pungent aromas of cactus and sweaty citrus suggest Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo, but this is mostly Merseguera with Macabeo and Moscatel thrown in. A pulpy palate is marginally focused, while this tastes of tropical fruits, namely grapefruit and passion fruit."
"If you like your Sauvignon Blanc on the grassy, herbaceous side, then this little number is for you. A mix of melon rind, candied ginger, lime leaf, and of course, grass show on the palate. Perfect for grilled veg on the barbecue."
"This informal, slightly sweet sparkler offers yellow pear, glazed almond and candied-citrus flavors. Vigorous bubbles and brisk acidity make up the bracing backdrop."
"This is a lightly herbal wine with crisp citrus and a tight texture. The wine with its mineral edge and chewy green-fruit flavor is dry, packed with acidity and ready to drink."
"Bready, oxidized aromas are imprecise and lacking in fruit. This is a blend of Palomino, Rufete Blanca and Moscatel from Salamanca, which is off the beaten path. A plump but flat palate of yeasty white-fruit flavors lacks zest on a fading finish. Drink now."
"Light, bright and crisp, this is a tangy wine. Its floral aroma and its juicy tropical fruits are both part of a wine that has been made to be drunk young, fruity and easily. Drink now."

"Punchy citrus aromas are prickly on the nose. This wine is quite citric in feel, with lemon extract and lime taking charge."
"The winery indicates this is from 2015, but there is no vintage shown on the bottle. On the sweet edge of brut, it smells and tastes of plastic, with a grainy, sugary mouthfeel and simple apple fruit."
"In half-and-half proportions, Gamay and the local Loire grape Grolleau combine in this medium-sweet ros. It is crisp, clean with red-berry fruits and balanced acidity. It is attractive and can be consumed as an apritif."
"Yeasty aromas indicate that early oxidation is setting in on this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. A lean palate with sizzling malic acid but little body deals bready flavors of generic white fruits. Oxidized flavor notes return on the finish."
"Funky aromas are sweaty, foxy and feline in nature. This doesn't have a lot of feel or texture, while the flavors on this brut nature are a bit weedy and grassy. The fruit character is quite short on the finish."
"This wine is comprised of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Dusty earthiness frames its green, vegetal flavors, wrapped in ripe, sturdy tannins and bitter leather and clove notes."
"The aromas are a little sweaty and the wine has not entirely knit together, even after four years. Fruit flavors are raisined, the acids feel chalky, and the finish resolves into some bitter phenolics."
"This organically farmed field blend includes some Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. It has soft acidity and a simple structure, the flavors a mix of red and black cherry and berry."
"This wine offers earthy funkiness and simple coconut and red currant notes, its structure somewhat muted and one-dimensional."
"There are odd hints of plastic in the nose and in the flavor, along with black-cherry fruit. In the mouth this wine feels disjointed, with a chalky, short finish and a hint of coconut."
"This lightweight wine has almost neutral aromas, light banana cream-like flavors butter and a soft texture. It's a curious confection from a usually crisp and zingy varietal."
"This simple off-dry sparkler has sweet peach, green apple and candied nectarine flavors. It's vigorous, with zesty acidity and brisk bubbles."
"This is a light-bodied, simple and straightforward wine with a generous helping of toasted oak, tropical fruit and sweet vanilla notes."
"Lightly vegetal aromas of asparagus and canned beans are intermixed with generic citrus scents. This wine is more acid than anything, with angularity to the palate. Salty, tart, citric flavors finish racy and with a lingering note of sour orange."
"Tawny copper in color, this starts out with a bit of spice that quickly disappears. It's thin without any fruit flavor at all, and finishes with a hint of plastic."
"Extremely light in color and shy on the nose, this is closer to water than wine. The flavors are also faint, recalling only slight touches of red apple and pear."
This sweet soft wine is lightly perfumed and gentle on the palate. Crushed strawberry flavors have just the lightest acidity to keep the wine from being cloying. Drink now.
This ber-simple sparkler has an extremely shy nose while the diluted off-dry palate offers mere suggestions of tropical fruit and a confectionery note. Brisk bubbles provide the backdrop.
"Oxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused. Citrus flavors are unconvincing, while this ros tastes soapy on the finish."
"Aromas of pear, corn and sweat are difficult. In the mouth this wine is extra tight and acidic, then chalky on the back palate. Short, sour flavors of gooseberry end quickly on a zingy finish."
"A sweaty nose obscures light strawberry flavors. Yeasty and thin, it's best used as a mixer."
"This simple summer sipper won't rock any worlds, but it pleases with candied pineapple, ginger, a hint of lime leaf and grass on the palate. Zippy acidity makes for easy weeknight glugging."
"Initially this wine smells buttery and nutty from oak influence, which morphs into notes of bruised yellow apple and very ripe melon. The palate is more vibrant, with zippy acidity and green fruit tones. The finish, however, falls a little flat."
"This extremely simple sparkler has subdued aromas suggesting adhesive bandage that carry over to the lean, brisk palate along with freshly squeezed lemon and a candied note. It's tart, with bracing acidity and vigorous bubbles."
"There's red fruit and spice to be found in this Marlborough Pinot Noir, but unfortunately they're overpowered by a chemical, menthol quality, along with vanilla from the oak influence. The palate is medium bodied with lightly grippy tannins and a bitterness on the finish."
This sunset-hued bubbly starts with notes of overripe berries and watermelon candy. The mousse is satisfying but the cloying sweetness on the palate may turn many off this less-than-subtle sparkler.
"Honeyed aromas of orange marmalade lead to a flat palate. Bitter flavors of melon and almond skins confirm that this oddball blend of Moscatel, Doradilla and PX from the mountains outside Mlaga is lackluster."
"A dull, unformed nose gives way to sweet dried prune notes in this highly ripe, earthy wine."
"Foxy plum and other jumpy aromas set up a raw, choppy palate. This Merlot tastes of salty, herbal plum and cherry, while the finish is lasting, which might not be a benefit."
Earthy and dried-herb aromas are followed by thin herbaceous flavors like celery and cucumber in this light-bodied wine. The texture is soft and watery.
"Stewy, earthy berry aromas are mulchy and lack freshness. This has a cooked and rubbery mouthfeel to go with stalky, savory berry and plum flavors. A green, leathery character shows on the finish."
"This wine smells and tastes quite mature but is still interesting to drink. It has sun-baked earth aromas, raspberry and Madeira flavors and a soft texture."
"Aromas suggesting damp earth and crushed gravel lead the nose while the extremely diluted, short palate shows the barest hint of lemon juice. This is about as basic as a wine can be."
"Cheesy tomato-based aromas are rubbery and fiery. This feels lean and monotone. Stewed, salty flavors of earthy berry fruits are off base and dirty, while this is cheesy tasting on the finish."
"This ultra rich style could be mistaken for a Chardonnay. Light gold in color, heady aromas of lemon curd, butter, ripe banana and bruised apple lead into a palate of baked stone fruit and toast, with medium to low acidity."
"Harsh, grassy, weedy berry aromas mix with a heavy amount of clove. In the mouth, this is screechy and way off balance. A clove-heavy flavor profile is oaky and messy on Kaiken's entry-level Malbec."
"If time waits for no one, don't wait for this. A blocky, jumbled nose of charred and baked black fruits is rustic and off-base. Clove, all-spice and other savory flavors dominate a heavy, unbalanced finish."
"Gamy, rubbery aromas mark this sizzler with major balance issues. Sour flavors of currant and lemon finish with nothing but acid."
"This wine is frankly old and downsliding, with aromas of pumpkin and corn flakes. A gold color and mildly oxidized apple-like flavors are tired."
"This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, rose, wild berry, crushed herb, dark spice and menthol. The palate is chiseled and loaded with finesse, doling out juicy red cherry, ripe strawberry, licorice and cinnamon flavors. It's structured with polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 20232043."
"This opulent, powerful wine has weight, richness and a beautiful creamy texture. It's built to age, from its wood aging to its minerality. Concentrated, it offers yellow fruits shot through with acidity. From the grandest Chardonnay vineyard in Burgundy, it will age well and be ready to drink from 2026."
"This textbook Barolo's new leather, cake spice and menthol aromas jump out of the glass. On the firmly structured palate, cinnamon and licorice notes underscore red cherry, cranberry and orange zest flavors. Tight, noble tannins and bright acidity provide the framework, suggesting it will age beautifully for decades. Drink 20232043."
"Ethereal aromas of baking spices, cinnamon and berry fruits convey exoticism. This Carignan from 90-year-old vines is saturated and a bit rubbery on the palate. Infinite flavors of nutmeg, spiced plum and berry fruits exude Priorat schist, while everything comes back on a strong finish with measurable tannins. Drink from 20192030."
"Wood, ripe fruit and a tight texture give this wine a very complete feeling. It is structured, mineral-driven and packed with fresh apples and yellow fruit. The impressive structure and balance suggest the wine will age well; drink from 2024."
"This block-designate wine shows flamboyant aromas of red cherry, cola, purple flowers and light caramel. The palate offers an amazingly cohesive and zesty experience, combining piquant cranberry and tart raspberry with slate-driven minerality and a persistent woody spice. The texture is soft, but lifted by strong acidity."
"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip."
"This is a stellar representation of the region, combining ripeness with dark earth and wild herb notes. Aromas of black cherry, crushed slate, turned loam, dried hibiscus and violets make for a lavish nose. The rounded palate weaves black raspberry together with gravel, thyme and sagebrush. Iron fist, silk glove, utterly delicious."
"A ripe, dense wine, this has powerful fruit and a serious long-term future. It is rich with yellow fruits with a generous, creamy texture, and tight with minerality. This gorgeous wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2024."
"Toasty aromas suggest maple, along with a note of sawdust to accompany earthy berry scents. A rich, pure palate is intense but shows balance and comportment. Blackberry, cassis, peppery spice and integrated oak flavors are detailed, with a smooth finish. Drink this full-bodied wonder through 2028."
"From one of the most coveted vineyards in the Central Coast, this is a well-balanced whopper of a wine, starting on aromas of fresh raspberry, black plum, forest floor, violets and dark chocolate. The palate is rich upfront, showing strawberry and other dark berries, and then gains complexity in notes of sandalwood and myrrh. Thanks to deep acidity and tannic framing, the wine is simultaneously bold and balanced."
"From the largest Grand Cru in Vosne-Romane, this wine has plenty of the structure as well as the fruit that shines in this vintage. It is rich and smoky with black fruits and red-berry flavors. The wine is still young, drink from 2026."
"This is the Arnoux family's top wine coming from vines on the revered hill of Corton. It is a powerful wine, properly rich and structured from the vintage. Wood and spice come through although they will soon integrate with the dense black-plum fruits and mineral texture. Drink the wine from 2025."
"Thickly concentrated at first, this wine settles in the glass to share a wealth of juicy black-cherry flavor that's impressively accented in black tea and cola spice. Medium bodied, it feels sublime on the palate and holds its ripeness in check, allowing a simmering acidity to speak."
"Regarded almost as a Grand Cru in its own right, the Moutonne vineyard, wholly owned by Albert Bichot, is in a corner of the Vaudsir Grand Cru vineyard. In this sumptuous year, the wine is more generous, ripe yellow fruits than mineral texture. The acidity and the tangy aftertaste are a reminder that this is from cool-climate Chablis. Drink from 2023."
"A full array of chaparral aromas arise prominently on this bottling, with thyme and sagebrush spicing up the smoke, earth, crushed slate and dark-cherry scents. The palate zings with snappy black-raspberry fruit, a great counterpoint to the savory shrubbiness that reflects the nose, with more wild herbs and eucalyptus notes. Quite a full experience."
"This gorgeous wine is floral and doughy, made entirely from Chardonnay and given time to mellow and mature over many years. The patience is rewarded in intensely complex layers of apple, pear and lemona caramelized backdrop providing appropriate richness and accents of gingerbread and doughy brioche."
"There's an unparalleled woody intensity on the nose of this offering, with cigar box, myrrh, incense and bay leaf decorating the black peppercorn, herb-laced salt, dark chocolate and black plum aromas. The palate's leathery flavors are woven into fine-grained tannins, revealing flashes of elderberry, violet and gravel. Drink 20192033."
"This Carignan welcomes you with fresh berry aromas that are like jam, accented by spice notes. Secondary aromas of coffee and toast lead to a full, saturated palate with a vise grip. Deep, savory flavors of roasted plum are spicy on a complex finish that blends power and elegance to the end. Drink from 20182030."
"An especially deep-gold color and enticing, expansive aromas indicate the extra aging time this Pinot Noir-based bubbly went through. Ripe pear, honey and toasted-almond notes weave across the palate as a rich mouthfeel is picked up by fine yet persistent bubbles. It is a delicious, mature wine that shows how complex and rewarding California sparkling wine can be with time. Keep through 2022."
"Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road. Black cherry and more vanilla make for a rich palate, but it's cut by an edge of acidity, darker elderberry, savory shiitake and a bay-leaf character that rises on the finish."
"Ripe red-cherry and strawberry aromas are lifted by grated clove and mace spice on the inviting nose of this bottling by longtime Winemaker Eric Hickey. A lively boysenberry-pomegranate combination explodes on the palate, where snapped sage sticks, wild thyme and dried rose petals make for an ethereally light yet stunningly flavorful wine."
"Enticing aromas of balsamic, leather, menthol, crushed herb, blue flower and dark culinary spice unfold on the nose. The focused palate boasts wonderful, nervy energy, showing red cherry, cranberry, white pepper, cinnamon and clove flavors framed by firm, elegant tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 20222032."

"This very lush and rich nose of this bottling, which also includes some Kimsey Vineyard fruit from Ballard Canyon, shows delicious aromas of baked blackberry pie, caramelized black currant, coconut and crme brle. Black cherry mousse, melted caramel, cappuccino and pralines show on the sip, which packs that expected Paso power."
"This vineyard is wholly owned by Domaine Bertagna, making it, in Burgundy terms, a monopole. The wine is still showing its wood aging, although the weight of ripe fruit will surely come through as it matures. It is a rich reflection of this fine vintage, dense and with packed with black-plum fruits and with a smoky aftertaste. Drink from 2022."
"This young, richly structured wine comes from a vineyard to the north of the town of Nuits Saint-Georges. It is powered by spice and toast from wood aging that are balanced by the ripe red-plum fruits and acidity. The combination is going to produced an impressive, foursquare wine as it ages. Drink from 2024."
"Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine. Starting with aromas of toasted oak and wood smoke, the wine has a broad rich mouthfeel and moderate tannins that propel the gorgeous fruit flavors across the palate and linger a long time on the finish."
"This blend of Grenache (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%) and Syrah (13%) explodes with potpourri, peat, white pepper, smoke and earth aromas. The palate is loaded with fruit and savory flavors that glide into the extended finish. The texture is absolutely dazzling."
"This 100% varietal wine delivers mineral, citrus twist, raw meat, raspberry and black pepper notes. The palate is full bodied and packed to the brim with fruit and savory flavors. It brings a seamlessness and length that are absolutely dazzling."
"This is a big but balanced expression of Cabernet that is ready to drink now. Layers of black cherry, caramel, vanilla, smoke and crushed black rocks show on the lavish nose. The palate's chalky texture is immediately apparent, with vibrant acidity that carries forth a rich crme de cassis flavor and finishes on roasted coffee and milk chocolate."
"This suave and sophisticated wine is so smooth to sip that its depth of flavor is a little deceptive. A subtle potpourri of clove, cinnamon, black tea and blackberry aromas swirl around a great core of mild acidity, fine-grained tannins and many layers of concentrated fruit flavor. The texture is velvety and the finish lingers for at least 30 seconds."
"Smooth, integrated aromas of cookie dough, forest floor and briary berry fruits lead to a palate that's plump on the edges but more intense and pulling in the middle. Flavors of ripe berry fruits, vanilla and tobacco finish with dry tannins and bold acidity, meaning this has more gas in the tank; drink through 2024."
"Clean and crisp aromas of Gravenstein apples, Bartlett pear and key lime pith meet with a slight hint of smoke wafting in the background on this bottling by onetime wunderkind Gavin Chanin. The sizzling acidity presents delicate flavors of nectarine, peach and mango, with a touch of butter toward the finish. The wine steadily improves days after opening. Enjoy now through 2025."
"This is a structured rich wine. It has great ripe fruit, generous with red berry and acidity in fine balance. It has a solid backbone of tannins although these are already well integrated into the opulent wine. Drink from 2021."
"Underripe raspberry, green-olive, dewy herbs, green-peppercorn and cardamom aromas show on the herbaceous nose. All of those elements are interwoven on the sip, where a core of fruit punch is laced by bay leaf, kalamata olive, bergamot and Christmas spice that persist deep into the finish."
"This unique blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Mourvdre and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Olsen, Les Collines and Waliser vineyards. Its savory herb, black currant, bramble, smoked meat, white pepper, orange peel and plum aromas pop. The palate is supple, elegant and balanced. A lengthy finish caps off the experience, which is as much about texture as flavor."
"Foresty berry aromas come with a whack of charred wood. In the mouth, this wine is rugged and loaded with intensity and acidity. Spicy oak and high-toned red-fruit flavors finish dry, juicy and with the structure to last years. Drink 20192035."
"The wine is tight with a strong mineral element over the acidity. It shows a sense of chalky terroir, full of red-currant fruits and a nervy aftertaste. It will take some time to fully develop, so wait until 2023."
"This is a ripe rounded wine, backed by the firm tannins that mark Pommard. It is bold, ripe with plenty of concentrated red fruits and finishing acidity. The wine has a crisp edge that lifts the tannins. Drink from 2023."
"Wiemer's standard dry Riesling is an impeccable value for a wine that offers such density of fruit and minerality. While dry in style, it's a luscious, deeply fruity wine studded with tangerine and stone-fruit flavors glazed in honey and nectar. It's unctuous and ripe, but finishes with a cool, steel-edged persistence."
"From one of the top Beaune premier crus, this wine is structured and dense with tannins and with wood aging. At the same time, it has the rich fruitiness of the year, broad red berries and plums. They provide the delicious potential of this fine wine. Drink from 2022."
"This small Premier Cru vineyard is wholly owned by the Devillard family. It is a rich wine, boasting layers of beautiful jammy red fruits and just the lightest touch of wood. Tannins are there, forming a core that will stand the wine in good stead as it ages. Drink from 2023."
"Grapy blackberry and cassis aromas come with charred oak and pastry-like richness. In the mouth, this notoriously ripe Menca is loaded with tannins. Spicy blackberry flavors can handle the classy oak this wine has seen, while flavors of tobacco, lemon and spice drape over a full-fruited finish. Drink through the 2020s."
"Leathery aromas of dark berry fruits and various spices comprise a deep and impressive bouquet. This wine is full on the palate, widespread and displays tannic scratchiness. Immense flavors of wild berry fruits and spice end with intensity and firm, sturdy tannins. Drink through 2023."
"This structured wine is full of fruit and has a tight texture. It shows a creamy side from new wood, although this is well integrated into the fruity acidity and the mineral edge. The wine is likely to age well, ready to drink from 2020."
"With the structure that is typical of Pommard, this wine also has a ripe richness from the vintage. The two together give a generous full wine with acidity and black-cherry fruits. Bold and ripe, it will age well. Drink from 2023"
"One of the better Malbec-based wines of the region, this fairly priced blend, which includes 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Petite Sirah and 2% Syrah, offers a dense core of blackberry jam that's covered by layers of loam, charred beef, black pepper and smoke. The dense black-cherry and blueberry flavors are cut by intense pepper, vanilla bean and prominent cappuccino, all frame by woody tannins."
"Unabashed in its alcohol levels, but not really boozy in any overdone way, this bottling offers very fresh, juicy and boisterous aromas of violet, candied blueberry, asphalt and pepper on the nose. The palate also starts with ripe blackberry and blueberry then grows more serious with grippy tannins and a zingy acidity. Dark chocolate and charred meat show in the midpalate."
"Bruno Copret has produced an impressive wine from this small vineyard on his property. It is still young, full of smoky wood and broad red-fruit flavors. The tannins and the concentration are considerable, although the wine also has a more stylish edge. Drink from 2019."
"From perhaps the best known of Mercurey's premier crus, this is a firm solid wine, dense with tannins and concentrated berry fruits. It has a ripe character that is still embedded in the tannins. That means aging and this wine should not be drunk before 2023."
"Red-berry fruits dominate this already delicious wine. Allied with the acidity and the toasty wood aging, it is balanced while, of course, still young. It has potential, rich with tannins and with fine fruits. The wine is structured, needing time. Drink from 2025."
"This wine's classic Nebbiolo scents of fragrant blue flower, new leather, aromatic herb and red berry waft out of the glass. The firmly structured palate offers Marasca cherry, sage, truffle and ground clove flavors framed by tightly woven but refined tannins and vibrant acidity. A licorice note rounds out the finish."
"Kudos to winemaker Doug Margerum for holding onto this extremely pleasing wine long enough for all the components to come together. Six years in, the aromas of cola, black cherry, rose petal, pepper dust and crushed gravel are still fresh and vibrant, while the palate remains upright due to structural tannins. Flavors of blackberry, raspberry and baking spice abound, making for an elegant wine."
"This is a very complete, well-balanced and satisfying wine that has a firm tannic structure to carry the tempting berry and black-cherry flavors. It starts with light cinnamon, clove and vanilla aromas that join loads of fruit on the palate, layering nicely for an interesting, complex and substantive character. Drink through 2025."
"Big, bold and rounded, this is a rich wine from a single vineyard. Red-plum fruits go with a plush texture that masks the firm tannins and dry core. The acidity and structure both promise long-term aging. The wine is still young, needing time. Drink this from 2022."
"This crisp, fruity wine is packed with acidity as well as citrus flavors. It has a cool feel, beautifully fresh and with a strong mineral element. Drink this structured, textured wine from 2019."
"This wine is crisp and fruity. With acidity as well as a light toast character, it is already balanced, bringing yellow and melon fruit flavors into the mineral texture. Drink from 2022."
"Very toasty aromas mark this wine. While the toast is present on the palate, it also offers plenty of fruit flavors, conveying apricot and white peach along with a citrus edge that brings out the freshness. Drink this wine from 2022."
"Cranberry and red currant are the stars of the show in this mountain wine, which is further accented in dried herb and lavender. Tart, tangy acidity supports firm pillowy tannins with a robust ripeness and lingering notes of leather and tobacco leaf."
"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravela very elegant expression overall."
"Aromas of barrel spice and vanilla lead the charge on this Tinto Fino that also contains 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. A tough, tannin-driven palate deals toasty flavors of black fruits, char and chocolate, which carry over to the finish. Call this an oak bomb, but at the very least the oak is of high quality and well integrated. Drink through 2025."
"This winery is making one of the best cases for Pinot Noir in the Paso Robles area. This bottling, which is quite dark in color, starts with black plum, mulberry, wet loam and a strong sense of umami on the nose, with hints of nori and teriyaki. The palate shows tart black-plum-skin flavors alongside juniper and more moist, turned-earth flavors. The acidity is persistent and tannins firm enough."
"This vibrant, slightly sparkling wine is one of the best Lambrucos out there. Made entirely from the Sorbara variety, it opens with enticing citrus, woodland berry and wildflower scents. Its crisp, delicious palate doles out strawberry and pink grapefruit notes alongside baking spice accents and racy acidity. The lees that have settled at the bottom of the bottle gives the last glass even more flavor."
"Heirloom tomatoes, tomato leaf, green olives, wild berries and green peppercorns make for a very herbal though entirely compelling expression of cool climate Pinot Noir. The green-pepper and tomato character carries onto the sip, delivering a very interesting wine though one that many seeking a riper style will not enjoy."
"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level."
"This 100% varietal wine is the winery's inaugural Cabernet Sauvignon and hails from the Rocks District. It's boasts all of Cabernet's prototypical aromas, from black currant to tobacco and herb, with a kiss of vanilla from having aged in 50% new French oak. It's soft and palate-coating in mouthfeel yet retains a strong sense of structure, with lightly chewy tannins. A fine interpretation of the variety with a downright dazzling feel."
"Structured, ripe and with great fruit, this is a bold warm wine. It has plenty of rich berry fruits, ripe tannins and layers of spice and toast. With its concentration, this is going to be a rich wine. Drink from 2022."
"This stand-out Cabernet Franc offers the structure and savory nuance of the Old World, but alongside a palate that's lusciously concentrated with ripe, succulent black fruit. Whiffs of violet and tea leaf reverberate from nose to finish, along with a bold yet velvet frame of tannins. Drinks gorgeously already but should meld in fruit, spice and perfume throughout the next decade."
"There are expected aromas of ripe blueberry, purple flowers, peppercorns and burnt bacon on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the Sta. Rita Hills, but Joey Tensley also packs in quite a bit of herbs, with bay leaf and dried chaparral. Tightly wound flavors of dark purple fruit, beef char and coarsely ground black pepper show on the tarry sip."
"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020."
"There's a slightly gamy, pleasantly rustic touch to the nose of this hearty bottling, with a broad and deep boysenberry base spiced up by dark cola, nutmeg and wet gravel aromas. The mouthfeel is very full and the tannic structure is tight, propping up flavors of dark mulberry, tree bark and more roasted game."
"Baked black cherry meets with nutmeg, clove and dried ginger on the very inviting nose of this bottling by Adam Lee. A sizzling acidity greets the palate, as do muscular tannins, with flavors of dark-red fruit, allspice and gingerbread falling into place."
"Chopped herb, fragrant blue flower, woodland berry and menthol aromas take center stage in this vibrant red. On the palate, clove and star anise notes underpin red cherry, cranberry and tobacco flavors. A hint of orange zest marks the finish while refined tannins and bright acidity provide the framework."
"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, forest berry and Alpine herb take center stage in this elegant and structured red. The vibrant palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and tobacco hints alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Impeccably balanced and delicious, it also offers incredible value. Drink through 2029."
"Dark, smoky, oaky aromas of tobacco, leather and black fruits lead to a palate that's muscular, tannic and solid as a pile of rocks. Cool, earthy black-fruit flavors include woodspice and dark-chocolate notes. This Menca from a cold year is flush, rugged and dry on the finish. Drink through 2025."
"Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon each make up a third of this wine, with smaller amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Its dark cherry, earth, flower and spice aromas are followed by concentrated and luscious but still refined cherry flavors. It shows a lot of structure and ripeness, in keeping with the warmth of the vintage."
"This is a very fine expression of this always richly structured appellation. It is still young, dominated by firm tannins as well as dark black fruits and the spice of wood aging. The acidity, the black cherry flavors and the density of the wine all suggest its great potential. Drink from 2020."
"Translated, the name of this vineyard means fogs, maybe a reference to a predisposition to get misty in the morning. Adjacent to Pommard, the wine has some of the structure of that village allied to the rounder character of Volnay. Together, these elements make for a wine that is likely to age well. Drink this ripe and smoky wine from 2023."
"There's a strong sense of the outdoors to the nose of this bottling (which includes 5% Viognier) from trampled sagebush and crusty fennel fronds to yard clippings, as well as elderberry and a touch of raw lamb. The palate is very tarry and savory, with thyme and bay leaf flavors riding above the dried dark fruit."
"This is one of the higher elevation premier crus in Puligny. In this warm vintage it has managed to give a wine that is crisp and mineral. To contrast with this, the wine also has a creamy, toasty character from the wood aging. Drink from 2021."
"This wine is the sum of many spectacular sitesincluding Ritchie and Heintz Vineyardssome of the cooler-climate spots for grapes in the Occidental. Together they sing a tasteful tune that's salty and demure, with an elegant imprint of green apple, ocean breeze and stone."
"This giant of a wine has aromas of charred oak, wood smoke and black pepper, with a palate of dense, deep and smoky tones that feel thick, tannic and chewy. It's a tour de force of spicy oak, fruit concentration and mouthcoating texture that's impressive to drink now but will be best after 2024."
"A superdark color and effusive aromas of wood smoke, raisin and dried fig set the stage for extremely concentrated, ripe fruit on the palate and a thickly tannic texture. The exuberance of the grape and blackberry flavors nicely counterbalances the firm texture. This will age well, so best to drink it after 2020."
"This is a consistently delicious wine, fermented in a combination of new and once-used French oak. Fully realized, it has a sublime texture and light body that's balanced by long, lingering acidity. The fresh-fruit flavors show elements of orange, lime, lemon and peach."
"This opulent wine has great fruitiness. The red-cherry fruits are already generously integrated with the tannins, offering richness. At the same time, acidity gives the wine a crisp edge. Drink from 2023."
"Very dark, very focused, and very pure, this full-bodied wine polishes the notorious tannins of the varietal just slightly, while pouring on dark chocolate, blackberry jam, white pepper and a touch of floral flavor. It's a great wine to buy and stash in a cool place for a few years to see how interesting Petite Sirah can get. Best after 2024."
"This wine's iris, perfumed berry, truffle and baking spice aromas emerge in the glass as it opens, along with a whiff of crushed herb. The structured, elegant palate shows ripe Marasca cherry, vanilla and mocha flavors alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 20192029."
"This magnum-sized bottling named after Joey Tensley's niece is a study of darkness, with asphalt, charred beef, black currant and a hint of purple flowers on the nose. It's suave and already elegant on the sip, with stewed blackberries and tart black plums, but it still needs time to grow into its sure-to-be-savory side. Drink 20192030."
"There's a sultry aromatic combination of stewed strawberry and bright raspberry as well as subtle thyme, tarragon, rosewater and French toast on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard. The baked red fruits and hard woody spices are cut by pungent acidity and firm tannins on the sip. Hold off a bit on this one, but then enjoy for decades. Drink 20192034."
"Fans of unoaked wine should look elsewhere. This is a sophisticated but showy wine matured in 100% new Hungarian oak barrels. It has lots to enjoy from the seductive aromas of melted butter and toasted almonds to the rich mouthfeel, ripe fruit flavors and extended, creamy-tasting finish."
"This ripe holdover from 2006 proves that Priorat wines can age well. This wine is full of licorice, spice cake and other heady aromas, while the palate is lush and chewy, but still hanging in there. Flavors of black fruits, chocolate, burnt toast, black coffee and licorice finish dense and long. Drink now through 2020."
"There is a fine perfumed character with this wine. It floats above the ripe cherry and berry fruits and the firm structure of rich tannins. The vineyard, centrally located in Nuits-Saint-Georges, has given a firm wine with the great potential to be generous. Drink from 2021."
"This red opens with reticent jammy aromas that expand to include licorice and asphalt notes. The wine is so saturated that it weighs down on the palate. Flavors of savory berry fruits are matched by saucy tomato and spice notes. On a sinewy finish, tomato sauce, raspberry and red-plum flavors stick out. Drink through 2026."
"Black currant, lavender, black pepper, soy and graphite show on the nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman, an assistant to Joey Tensley. There is a flash of lavender at the tip of the sip, and then the darkness descends, with charred meats and blackened berries cut by a strong acidity. It still needs time to develop, but these wines disappear fast, so stock up."
"Quiet and aromatically floral, this is a wine given time in both stainless steel and concrete, as well as a sizable percentage of neutral French oak. Lemon zest and grapefruit adorn a robust body of stony minerality and touches of spicy lemongrass."
"Initial aromas of damp earth and coffee grounds are a bit misleading because this tastes almost entirely of ripe, slightly baked black fruits. This is a massive Cabernet-based wine with severely scratchy tannins. On the finish, rugged leftover tannins are like gravel, while this is saturated in a familiar Priorat way. Drink from 20192027."
"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this benchmark New York sparkling wine balances pristine apple and lemon against layers of complex toast, caramel and crushed mineral nuances. Brut in style, it calibrates spine tingling acidity against a palate that's supple and ripe. Bold, mouthfilling bubbles dissipate elegantly through a long finish."
"This Syrah appeals to all the senses, leading with blackberry, bramble, kirsch, mineral and crushed flower aromas. The palate is rich and dense, holding nothing back with its opulent black fruit flavors. A hedonistic expression of the variety."
"Blackberry and raspberry flavors are ripe and juicy yet invigoratingly crisp in this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Subdued spice and perfumed violet notes enhance bold berry flavors on the midpalate. A well-integrated package with finely textured tannins, it's ready to drink now but should improve through 2025."
"The white wines of Pernand-Vergelesses have managed to preserve a cool, crisp character even in warm 2015. This wine has the citrus well to the fore along with flavors of wood aging and spice. It is tangy and mineral, with a bright textured aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"Big, richly fruity and quite tannic, this concentrated wine pulls off good balance, as the ripeness and near-sweetness of the fruit flavors seems to dissolve some of the firm grip in the texture. Aromas like tobacco, pencil lead and cedar keep coming as the wine opens up in the glass."
"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from old vines at the Dionysus vineyard, this includes 12% Cabernet Franc and a splash of Merlot. It's spicy and toasty, with ripe fruit flavors recalling strawberry preserves and cherry pie. Coffee and smoke hints thread throughout and into the finish. It's oaky in the best way and delicious from start to finish."
"This unabashedly powerful and jammy wine shows black-cherry candy, sweet roses, vanilla, black rocks and black pepper on the nose. The soft tannins carry forth waves of vanilla, coconut, caramel and blueberry jelly, perfect to please those seeking a whopper of a wine."
"Have you ever tried varietal Baboso Negro from the island of Tenerife? Give it a shot and you'll likely be impressed, as I was. Cherry and plum aromas are in the red zone, while this wine feels crisp and fresh, with edge. Salty raspberry and plum flavors end with racy snap. This is a versatile and elegant food wine; drink through 2020."
"This Petite Sirah, enhanced by 8% Syrah and 1% Viognier, is extremely dense on the nose, with aromas of blueberry, black currant, vanilla, tarragon and fudge. Mouthcoating tannins and powerful acidity bloom on the palate, where black-cherry-laced chocolate-cake flavors rise to an espresso bean finish."
"A stacked nose includes aromas of tomato, herbs, cocoa, molasses and berry fruits. The saturated palate announces that this is a big one, while spicy flavors of plum and berry fruits are slightly herbal on a finish with excellent feel and flow. Drink this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenre through 2021."
"At first, this is plump on the nose, with cherries and warm star anise. Aromas of dried plum skins, orange rind and bitter black tea then reveal layers of complexity. Light in body and energetic on the palate, it shows strong peppery spice against the tart red fruit, making for a very lively experience."
"A big firmly structured wine with solid tannins and black-plum-skin texture, the wine is rich and dense. Its fruits are balanced by the concentrated tannins and by the sense of restrained power. Drink from 2023."
"Foxy blackberry and cassis aromas are young and untamed, with a note of wet animal fur. This Menca is grapy and rich, with a dense, saturated palate. Chocolaty black-fruit flavors finish with hard tannins, lots of residual fruit and a structure that suggests that this wine is here to stay for a while. Drink 20192025."
"This stunning red was a favorite amidst a strong line up of North Fork Cabernet Franc. There's a purity of black cherry and plum flavors here, but also meandering veins of animal, earth and herb that feel a bit savage and wild. Crisply composed, it finishes with delicate whispers of anise and cinnamon. Ready to drink now but should improve through 2024."
"Vibrant aromas of black raspberry, black cherry, cigar box, wet soil and dried oregano are reminiscent of classic Bordeaux in this blend of 34% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 9% Malbec and 9% Petit Verdot. Rounded red fruits show on the front and finish of the sip, but the midpalate is layered with olive, crushed pepper, marjoram and black tea."
"Plump blackberry and black currant meet with asphalt and dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a relatively new vineyard on Gypsy Canyon in the heart of the appellation. Dried violets, lavender, tart boysenberry, peppercorns and a hint of cardamom make for an exotic yet balanced palate."
"From two sections of the producer's historic estate vineyard, this wine combines 53% Viognier, 33% Roussanne and 14% Marsanne, all fermented and aged in stainless steel. Together, they offer a dry balanced expression of green apple, Meyer lemon, tart pineapple and integrated oak."
"A smoky, heady nose is defined mostly by char, coffee and black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, this wine is solidly built but not too heavy. Toasty, chocolaty blackberry and cassis flavors don't change much on a bold, blocky finish that stays the course. Drink through 2027."
"Dusty aromas of tea and dried spices blend well with black olive and black-fruit notes. This wine has a lean but muscular build. Plum and wild berry flavors come with dry, spicy oak accents. Acidity keeps the finish in shape and ensures length; drink through 2022."
"Firm and structured, this is a solid wine that will take time to mature. The vineyard, backed by woods, is considered one of the top premier crus in Mercurey. Certainly, this wine with its solid tannins and wood flavors that are backed by acidity and red-berry fruits, is one with a serious future. Drink from 2021."
"A bit of bottle age has made this vintage quite fascinating, with cola, black tea, black plum and mulberry on this wine's deep and peppery nose. The flavor profile is hearty with star anise and dried spearmint as well as deeper dried red-fruit touches. The texture is mild but the overall experience is complete."
"Big, tight and tannic, this is a full-fledged dinner wine that needs to pair with a nice caloric veal shank or lasagna. It's made with 80% Syrah, so the color is almost black, the aromas are spicy and smoky and the flavors feature black cherry, espresso and dark chocolate. The texture is both mouth filling and a bit astringent due to hefty tannins."
"A delicious, refreshingly crisp wine, this has an excellent balance between acidity and bright apple fruits. In the background, the wood aging and vanilla flavors give an extra dimension. Drink now."
"Baked red cherry, vanilla dust and a slight edge of bay leaf show on this well-rounded estate bottling from the pioneering brand. Ripe raspberry and pomegranate meet with sagebrush, anise and more bay leaf on the sip."
"Quite dry and reserved in flavor, this wine is intriguing: subtle rose petal and mineral notes, medium body and a bite of grapefruit zest on the finish that begs for another sip. One of the earliest producers of Gewrztraminer wines in Anderson Valley, it's still one of the best."
"This is a superbly rich wine that is packed with generous black fruits and balanced acidity. It has structure and concentrated plum and damson fruits. The wood aging still shows in what is young wine, although this will go. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
"A perennial knockout, this wine continues to impress. The estate-grown grapes are picked specifically to make a bone-dry refreshing palate pleaser that's pretty in pink and orange tones. Tart, crisp and broadly appealing, it's an effortless experience dripping in grapefruit and blood orange."
"Crisp, juicy and fruity, this is a wine that has red-currant flavors under the tannic structure. It is a delicious wine that is light, fruity and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2023."
"Vanilla, cocoa, graphite, woodspice and black cherry aromas lead to polished blackberry and cherry flavors in this Cabernet. It shows a fine balance and texture that piques interest, and a distinctive spice note that lingers on the finish."
"This wine is not at all petite, with its richly layered and concentrated palate. It has an abundance of fine-grained tannins to support its opulent flavors of dark fruits and oaky spices. Full bodied but plush and soothing in texture, it blends in 15% Petit Verdot. Drink through 2022."
"Floral aromas like rose and lilac give this lush and fruity wine a unique character. It has very ripe, exotic fruit flavors that resemble blueberries, macerated cherries and boysenberries. Subtle oak nuances form a lightly spicy background, while firm tannins add grip to complete a nicely balanced and high-intensity package."
Intensely ripe and concentrated fruit flavors dominate both the aromas and flavors of this very full-bodied but ultrasmooth wine. Light notes of dried sage and cinnamon dust the blackberry jam and candied-strawberry flavors for a nuanced complexity despite the high alcohol and supreme ripeness.
"This is a bold, very ripe and full-bodied wine that has a good frame of firm tannins and acidity to give it an appetizing texture. While packed with plump, almost sweet flavors like blackberry jam, it is nicely dry and well balanced, leading to a lingering finish that last for 30 seconds."
"Alluring aromas of cocoa powder, berry fruits, graphite and raw oak lead to a jammy palate with density and weight. This old-vines Monastrell tastes of chocolaty oak and herbal blackberry. On the finish, it's tight and rugged, with mildly scratchy tannins and a saucy aftertaste. Drink through 2022."
"A nose led by aromas of fine oak, raspberry and mild spices opens this blend of 80% Carmenre and 20% Malbec. In the mouth, it's nicely built, with delicate layering and not too much weight. Toasty, spicy red-fruit flavors include a tobacco note and the wine tastes a bit chocolaty on the tail end. Drink through 2023."
"Alluring Nebbiolo aromas of dark berry, purple flower, baking spice, truffle and herb slowly unfold in this wine. The savory, succulent palate doles out Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and licorice flavors against a backdrop of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity."
"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this boasts enticing blue flower, wild berry and cake spice scents. The fresh, elegant palate evokes strawberry, raspberry, candied nectarine and ginger, the flavors framed by vibrant acidity. It finishes crisp and dry."
"From selected parcels of the Ollires estate, this wine is impressive. It has weight but that is balanced by the acidity and the generous black fruits and acidity. This is certainly a wine that has been well aged, although it would pay to wait another year before drinking. So drink this very fine wine from 2018."
"This bottling, which is balanced by 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, rides the savory edge of the grape, with aromas of underbrush and dried herbs giving depth to the black-olive and black-currant aromas. The palate offers a mix of red and darker fruits, including cranberry, plum and blackberry, with touches of thyme and anise."
"In this opulent, layered and full-bodied wine, a smoky beefy aroma and a melt-in-the-mouth texture come with flavors of dark maraschino cherries, dark chocolate and baking spices. It's very mouth filling and mouth coating as well as firmly tannic, but the richness of the flavors helps it to drink very smoothly."

The palate is saturated with dark fruit flavors while firm, structured tannins provide support. It needs some time in the cellar to settle. Best after 2022."
"Extremely dark and viscous in the glass, this 100% Zinfandel shows dark intensity on the nose, with aromas of hearty blueberry, crushed violet, vanilla and black pepper. The blueberry element explodes onto the palate, but it's tightened up by a rocky texture and a touch of pepper dust."
"Concentrated and potent fruit flavors fill this Bordeaux-style blend practically to the point of bursting.

"Though without the richness that has defined California Cab in recent decades, this bottling is more of a classic Old World-leaning expression that is slowly coming back in vogue.

It's one of the better Sauv Blancs of the vintage."
"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well."
"This wine's truffle, underbrush, dark berry and baking spice aromas take center stage.

Give it time to fully come together. Drink 20212028."
"Very dark in the glass, this inky wine shows aromas of iodine, distilled violets and wound-up black-currant fruit, making the Syrah appear in charge.

A tight medium-to-full palate is the staging ground for fresh plum and berry flavors that are powerful but not heavy. A long, warming finish maintains the wine's core potency. This is not ready to drink; best from 20192028."
"Like an ugly duckling that's a beautiful swan in waiting, this unique ros, if you can call it that given its rusty, almost brown color, is something only Terroir Al Limt would bottle. Earthy in aromas, this mix of several Grenache strains tastes of apricot and dried red fruits. It's mildly spicy throughout, with actual tannins from skin contact. Drink this quasi ros as you would a serious white or red, meaning with good food like a Catalan-style rice dish. And drink now."
"Pale yellow pink in color, this is one of the better ross of the vintage, showing lush but restrained aromas of peach crme frache along with lemon zest and crushed limestone. There is fabulous energy and texture on the sip, where chalky flavors meet with red apple and a hint of rosewater."
"There is an impressively persistent stony quality to the nose and palate of this bottling. On the nose, that takes the form of a rainy cement note, which, along with lime-skin and pith scents, give fresh tension to the broad peach and pear aromas. On the palate, it's all about grippy texture, which holds up green apple, underrripe pluot and lime-wedge flavors."
"This single-vineyard Tempranillo opens with smooth, straightforward dark-fruit aromas that are calm and collected. A deeply stacked palate is a touch fierce but well structured. Toasty blackberry and cherry flavors linger on a toast-etched finish. Drink through 2032."

"This is a very opulent bottling by Steve Martell, who blends 83% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Mourvdre to deliver aromas of black-plum sauce, hot licorice, hoisin and buttery pie crust.

"Made from 86% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Cabernet Franc, this shows brooding aromas of spice and black and red fruit, followed by ripe, concentrated, plump fruit flavors. The tannins are grainy, calling for additional time in the cellar or a long decant to mellow."
"This well-made red blend has no shortage of ripe black-fruit flavors or gripping texture. It's full bodied, very dark in color, smells like cinnamon, clove and cherries, and tastes very ripe and concentrated: like chocolate covered cherries without the sweetness."
"Mellow and subtle, this is a soft-spoken but deeply flavorful special bottling from Navarro. It has great balance, reserved raspberry and black cherry flavors and an appetizing, firmly tannic texture. Save a few bottles until 2020 to see how well it develops."
"Vivid flavors and zippy fruit acidity give this medium-bodied blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Smillon a big but refreshing personality. It has vibrant citrus and fresh herb aromas, crisp grapefruit and lemon flavors, and a sense of depth on the palate without being heavy. There are so many ways this would start a meal off right."
"This varietal Listn Negro from Tenerife in the Canary Islands opens with minerally cherry aromas offset by notes of earth and leather. A juicy, clamping palate with salty plum and raspberry flavors ends with light spice notes. This is elegant and svelte, but packs punch. Drink through 2021."
"Grenache Blanc is an up-and-coming variety in the state. This standout example brings talc, flower, pear and citrus aromas. The medium-bodied palate is tart and lively, piquing interest."

It's satisfyingly plump with black fruit, but also brambly, herbaceous, and accented by deep, rich soil notes. Brisk acidity and a fringe of fine-grained, persistent tannins lend tautness and structure to the palate. Drink now through 2023."

"This blend of 91% Syrah and 9% Grenache delivers a load of wild herbs and forest undergrowth to the savory nose, giving depth to the cassis and vanilla aromas. That garrigue character is wrapped around the mulberry and boysenberry core of the palate, where touches of smoke and roasted pork complete the sip."

It's a very pretty expression of the variety that should show especially well at the dinner table."

"Clove, star anise and deep strokes of red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from one of the estate's best blocks. The palate is redolent with bay leaf and eucalyptus, which give depth to the red-cherry, cranberry and tart pomegranate flavors."
"Floral-based aromas of violet and blueberry announce this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that also smells of hickory and campfire. A choppy, drawn-in palate is herbal and savory, with blatant oak accenting earthy berry flavors. A roasted finish with hard tannins calls for more aging or decanting. Drink through 2023."
"This wine is rounded, rich and full of ripe fruit. Its wood flavors, giving spice and vanilla, are a backdrop to the generous apricot and pear flavors and good acidity. Drink this wine from 2022."

"From vines planted in 1982, this delivers exuberant lychee, spice, rose petal and citrus zest aromas. It's dry and medium-bodied on the palate, with spice-driven flavors and floral notes that persist on the (slightly warm) finish. It drinks well on its own but really sings at the dinner table."

"Ripe and fruity, this has a rich texture that comes both from the generous white fruits and from the cut of lemon acidity. A mineral-textured wine, it's crisp now and will likely round out to bring out the ripeness. Drink from 2019."
"Clean lines of grapefruit, lime and lemongrass make for a fresh, somewhat angular nose on this zesty tongue-tingling bottling.

Soft tannins coat the mouth fully."
"The Daou brothers break a bit from their polished house style to dive into gamy wonders in this blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 12% Tannat and 8% Tempranillo, with a nose that shows burned tire, bacon fat, underripe plums and freshly paved street.

"From a vineyard block full of little stones, this bottling shows cherry cola, sagebrush, rose petals, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla on the nose.

"Almost as buttery as a croissant, this full-bodied and extremely flavorful wine has an aroma like butterscotch, flavor like melted butter and vanilla, and a lingering pastry-like accent on the finish. The texture is buttery, too, coating the palate and revealing layers of richness."
"Sourced from the Two Blondes vineyard, this is a soft, smooth and toasty blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc, and 27% Merlot. Its delicious barrel flavors are nicely integrated with its purple fruit.

The balance is spot-on, kicking it up a notch."

It's ready to drink now with a brief decanting but could improve through the next decade."

"Whispers of fresh green herbs lend elegance and restraint to this impeccably balanced Bordeaux-style red.

Delicate in tannins, it's approachable already but should drink well through 2025."

"This is a richer style of Sauvignon Blanc, as would be expected from the Daou brothers, but is a fresher style than the last vintage. Aromas of toast, oak and yellow fruit prove quite seductive, and the palate proves grippy with dried lemon peels and cut-grass touches. There's just a hint of smoke on the sip."
"This wine was made by Rhne-variety specialist James Mantone of Syncline. The aromas are locked up at present but suggest mineral, spice and red and blue fruit as it opens. The palate is full bodied, seamless and pure, showing depth and detail."
"From Quinta Santa Rosa Vineyard, this blend of three clones shows plump red-plum and hibiscus aromas on the nose as well as sharp cinnamon, cola and sumac spices. That tangy sumac character extends to the sip, where tart raspberry makes the eyes water. Also present are fine-grained tannins and a slight touch of Early Grey tea."

"This is a single-vineyard wine which is beautifully rich and already soft and smooth enough to drink. To be sure, it will age further and mellow with time, but for now it is the ripe red-berry fruits and generous tannins that are so attractive. Drink now and until 2026."
"Dominated by its young tannins, this perfumed wine is bright with acidity. It has spice, an intense, crisp character and the need to age for a considerable time. Drink from 2023."

"This ripe, generous wine is full of the bold red fruits of this fine vintage. It also has structure, spicy wood flavors and a rich, full character. With its juicy acidity in the background and its impressive density, the wine is going to age a little longer. It will be best from late 2018."

"Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge."
"Elegant and nuanced, this penetrating Cabernet Franc offers bold strokes of blackberry and plum tinged with hints of wet soil, crushed mineral and spice. It's bold and lusciously composed but there's a puckery-fresh brightness of acidity that's delightful. Released with extended cellar aging, its soft, feathery tannins are approachable already but it's still structured enough to improve well through 2025."
"Primary, concentrated raspberry and cherry flavors pierce through the core of this rich, fruity Pinot. Subtle oak aging lends delicate vanilla, spice and nut tones, but it's an elegant, finely structured wine with crisp acidity and fine, persistent tannins.

"Always made to shine at the table, this crisp refined white is a celebration of lemon zest, green apple and wet stone, integrated in oak and bright acidity. Further flavors of pear and white peach complement the memorable proceedings."
"Grapy aromas of cassis and blackberry are fairly foxy, with a whiff of wet animal fur. An intense palate is held together by firm, rubbery tannins. Black cherry and dark-plum flavors are lasting on a finish that's ripped with intensity. Best from 20192024."
"This wine's plum, vanilla, milk chocolate and blue fruit aromas are followed by a palate saturated with supersmooth fruit and barrel flavors. The variety isn't immediately apparent, but it's delicious all the same."
"Very easy-to-like aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and green tea ice cream show on the nose of this bright and vivacious wine by Dave Potter, one of the forefathers in the evolution of Santa Barbara's Funk Zone neighborhood.

"This is a very big and jammy wine, but it's made with expert structure and elegance as well as affordability. Concentrated blackberry, black-currant, smoked beef and lavender aromas arise from the dark juice in the glass. The crme de cassis richness at the tip of the sip dries up into tight tannins and touches of fennel and thyme."
"A smoky stony mineral element gives this Rhne-style blend an unorthodox, austere but fascinating personality. Those earthy qualities meet crisp reserved grapefruit and white peach on the palate where a tangy and at first slightly astringent texture warms up to reveal a richer lingering finish."
"Made from fruit grown both on Howell and Diamond mountains, this wine is powerful and concentrated, bursting in mountain tannins. Waxy plum, dried herb, graphite and pencil shavings provide a savory tangy underbelly of woody accents, met and complemented by robust black cherry and cassis, the palate rounded at the finish."
"This wine from cooler climate plantings of both grapes will appeal to many palates, with aromas of baked boysenberry pie and hints of vanilla, nutmeg and star anise. The hot pie flavors extend to the sip, where they are enhanced by hints of spearmint, pepper and fresh herbs. It's quite tasty and fulfilling."
"This is one of the better wines emerging from Southern California, specifically San Diego County, where vintners should bet on Italian varieties. Pretty and fresh aromas of rose petals, crushed pomegranate, allspice, hibiscus, sandalwood and light licorice lead into a palate full of cedar-laced raspberry flavors, rounded by hints of molasses and chai."

"This wine is quietly powerful, packed with tightly wound fruit flavors that are wrapped in a firm coating of velvety tannin. It has plenty of grip on the palate, but also plenty of underlying blackberry, boysenberry and black-pepper flavors. It's sure to improve with time, so best to drink after 2022."
"Joey Tensley departs from his usual dark fruit intensity to weave together a more chaparral spice-driven Rhne-style blend in this bottling, which shows marjoram, bay leaf and sweet sage on the nose. The palate packs those dried herbs onto a beef roast, throwing in dusty earth and dried berries to round out the sip."
"This blend of 70% Roussanne and 30% Viognier makes a great option for those seeking an strong white wine alternative to rich Chardonnay. The nose is touched by honey, honeysuckle, crme frache and ripe cherimoya fruit. The palate is very creamy and full bodied, with flavors of sea salt, lemon and dried apricot."
"This bottling offers cassis, blackberry syrup, crushed slate and lots of purple flowers on the nose. It's a big and boisterous expression of the grape at first sip, which bursts with boysenberry, but then grows very mineral in the midpalate, with gravel and lava rock flavors. The tight tannic structure goes deep into the finish."
"This wine's woodland berry, rose petal, dark spice, chopped herb and espresso aromas fill the glass. Elegantly structured, the palate offers Marasca cherry, clove and star anise flavors framed by fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity."
"This wine's bright, fruit-forward raspberry, herb, cocoa and barrel spice aromas are followed by exquisitely pure, elegant red plum flavors that coat the palate from end to end. A delicious rendition of this seldom seen variety."
"High toned aromas mark the nose of this wine, including dried herb, fresh plum, huckleberry and spice. Its purple fruit flavors are rich and lush, with a pleasing purity that carries through the finish. It's uncharacteristic of Sangiovese but brings undeniable appeal."
"From the Preston Vineyard in Templeton Gap comes this blend of 29% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 21% Petit Verdot, 13% Merlot and 12% Malbec, which is full of violet, deeply red cherries and cranberries and charred meat on the nose. The palate starts with a somewhat sweet touch of red currant but then tightens on elegant graphite, potpourri, cigar box and white-pepper flavors, all framed by chalky tannins."

"Creamy oak and raisiny notes announce ripeness and richness that turn to complexity as this Syrah airs out. In the mouth, this is full-force, with choppy tannins and tomato-like acidity. Spice, herb and plum flavors finish dry, toasty and well balanced. Drink through 2021."

There is zippy acidity on the sip, with intriguing flavors of dried apple, chamomile and lemon syrup, as well as an earthy quality of sandy soil and dried yellow flowers."
"Extremely tight and herbal aromas of cut grass, chives, scallions and oregano ride a fascinatingly rainy cement minerality on the nose of this fresh and vibrant bottling. The wet-cement flavors show powerfully on the sip, with lemongrass, wild lime leaves and more mowed-lawn touches."
"This smells and tastes like a pale Pinot Noir and has some of the body and smooth texture of a red wine, too. Tasty cinnamon, nutmeg and red-cherry flavors get plenty of uplift from zingy acidity, so the balance is great and the finish lingers."
"This bone-dry, steely-textured wine is crisp and bracing due to firm acidity, fruity-but-not-sweet flavors and maybe a touch of tannin that adds to the firm mouthfeel. Like a squeeze of lemon on the pan-roasted fish, it will make a great counterpoint to lots of things on the menu."
"This smooth wine is rich with yellow fruits, an opulent texture and a sprinkling of spice. The acidity and the crisper citrus flavors in the background give the essential lift to this ripe wine. Drink now."
"With vines forming part of the 22-acre Jessiaume estate, this vineyardone of the better known of the Beaune premiers crushas produced a fine, rich wine in this vintage. Although there is plenty of young wood, the fruit is so rich and generous, with such fine potential. Give this opulent wine until 2022."
"Although the oak imprints strong flavors in this wine, it's still young, so all the spice and toastiness will integrate. The fruit is there, showing a rich medley of apples, pears and citrus. As it matures, the texture will flesh out to result in a generous wine with a promising future. Drink from 2020."
"This wine's coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, coconut, herb and cherry aromas are followed by a rich, full bodied palate loaded with black fruit flavors and generous barrel accents. Its oak influence seems prominent at times but doesn't stand in the way of its hedonistic appeal."
"Winemaker Billy Wathen makes so many single-vineyard wines that he's able to play around with styles, and uses this bottling to explore the lower alcohol side of Pinot Noir. Extremely floral aromas of rose petals, hibiscus and carnation meet with light raspberry on the elegant nose, while the lighter-bodied palate mixes slightly sour red fruit with cedar, thyme and oregano."
"Aged 22 months in French and American oak, this wine hails from a rolling hillside in the appellation and is 100% varietal.

"For a different breed of cat, take a look at this blend of Merenzao (Trousseau), Menca and Garnacha from Valdeorras in Galicia. An elegant, schisty nose displays gamy, savory plum and currant aromas similar to Pinot Noir. A choppy, astringent palate makes this wine less than smooth. Herbal plum and spicy oak flavors are bolstered by racy acidity and finish long and almost citrusy in flavor. Drink through 2022."

A smooth palate with a touch of buttery oak tastes of savory plum, cherry and spice. A long finish is comfortable on the fade."
"This wine's aromas are quite restrained but include whiffs of red fruit and spice. The palate is light to medium bodied, showing both subtlety and balance. A lovely wine lacking only in aromatic expression."
"An unusual opening of cookie dough and black-fruit aromas suggests a ripe wine, and this is definitely on the full side. While the palate is chunky and lacks a distinct focal point, flavors of tomato, herbs and baked plum are complex and meaty. A leathery feel along with herbal plum flavors defines the finish."
"Balsamic notes of menthol and crushed mint mingle with dark culinary spice, coffee bean and stewed fruit aromas in this wine. The forward palate shows sweet and sour notes of mature, fleshy black cherry, prune, licorice and clove alongside seasoned tannins. A toasted hazelnut note closes the finish Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit and freshness."

"Spicy plum aromas are accompanied by appealing oak scents. While this wine doesn't show the greatest of ease and flow on the palate, flavors of plum, cassis, clove and cinnamon are persuasive. A blocky, rubbery, tannic finish with roasted notes is more about power than finesse. Drink through 2023."

"Very wound-up aromas of dried and dark red berries and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from Temecula, another sign that Italian varieties can thrive in the warmer climate. The flavors are impressively deep and spicy, with black currant, blackened berries, pencil shavings, vanilla and char."
"Fat in mouthfeel, waxy and earthy in aroma and packed with apricot and almond flavors, this layered and concentrated wine emphasizes savory notes rather than fruity ones and lushness in texture rather than crispness. Dried meats like prosciutto and salami could make great pairings."
"This blend of 50% Grenache, 42% Syrah and 8% Mourvdre shows broad aromas of strawberries, baked red plums and sagebrush, proving quite inviting and playful despite the dramatic and intense label. That playfulness arises on the sip too, where wild berry and red-currant flavors pair with garrigue touches of dried sage and pepper."
"This is an elegant, refined and lighthearted red that shines with a wooded tannin structure and accents of pencil and clove. Rounded and smooth on the palate, it's bright and succulent in blackberry and black currant flavors, with well-integrated oak."
"Having spent multiple years in barrel, this iconoclastic producer's take on the variety is refreshingly real and different: big boned and yet sinewy and elegant in its way. Eucalyptus and bay leaf compete for attention on the nose around an herbal core of cedar and current. The wine is softly layered and well structured."
"A mix of pulpy citrus fruit and citrus-peel aromas is ever so slightly oxidized. This dry varietal Pedro Ximnez feels full, integrated and balanced. Mild oxidation lends a bready note to apple and melon flavors, while this is lasting on the finish. Drink now."
"Flavorful but also gentle on the palate, despite the brand name, this is a lushly textured, full-bodied wine that lifts beautiful blueberry and blackberry flavors on fine-grained tannins. It has lightly spicy aromas, a mouthfilling viscosity and long finish."
"Extremely fresh and lively aromas of soft strawberry and lime pith combine to make a very racy edge to the nose of this bottling from the pioneering property, which was founded as a bubbly house in the early 1980s. There is great energy to the sip, where somewhat sour flavors of Ruby Red grapefruit rind give the wine lots of acidic length."
"This wine is ripe, rounded and fwell balanced. It has great fruitiness, spice from wood aging and a generous texture. The wine is delicious, rich and ready to drink."
"Citrus-driven, this wine is made from the producer's State Lane Vineyard in Yountville, and is beautifully aromatic in honeysuckle and hibiscus. Medium bodied and balanced in style, it's dry and bristling in acidity, the flavors sharply defined in grapefruit and tangerine."
"A small proportion of oak fermentation on this intensely primary Chardonnay lends depth and a rounded mouthfeel to its buoyantly fresh peach and tangerine characteristics. Cutting grapefruit and lime acidity refreshes the palate, guiding a long, pristine finish. Enjoy young to maximize its fresh appeal."
"Made light and bright, this wine combines 56% Viognier with 22% Roussanne and 22% Marsanne. The three varieties are fermented in stainless steel to preserve the lean linear characteristics of lemon and lime that wrap around crisp tight acidity, the entirety buoyant in floral honeysuckle."
"While bountiful in ripe, plush nectarine, peach and melon, this medium-sweet Riesling off sets its sunny side with dazzling acidity. Light on its feet yet deeply penetrating, it's an effortless people pleaser offering balance and satisfaction."
"Very light in the glass and fresh on the nose, this bottling by Chumash tribe descendant Tara Gomez offers aromas of lemon blossom and honeydew rind. There is good tension to the sip, which is very much focused on texture, with flashes of green apple skins and lime peels, proving quite tight and zesty."
"This blend of 50% Mourvdre, 33% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot comes from the Kimsey (Ballard Canyon), Jada (Paso Robles) and Jack McGinley (Happy Canyon) vineyards. Straight-ahead aromas of baked blackberry, anise and purple flowers lead into a palate that's tight at the tip and still very wound up. Strong acidity and fine-grained tannins will reveal the slowly emerging dark fruit and sagebrush flavors in due time."
This extroverted reserve-style wine combines generous buttery and nutty nuances with crisp and bracing apple and Anjou-pear flavors to find a very good balance. It feels full bodied and luxurious but stays lively due to good grape acidity.
"Rich fruit over a crisp texture gives this wine a balanced character. Ripe with yellow fruits and cut with acidity, it will be delicious when it ages. Drink this still-young wine from 2020."
"The smoothness of white wines in this vintage is very apparent in this ripe, rounded bottling. With enough acidity and citrus flavors to balance the melon and peppered-pear flavors, the wine is balanced and full in the mouth. Age until 2019."
"A touch of buttered popcorn is in the aroma. Rich toasty flavors give an assertive, attractive oaky personality to this medium-bodied wine made from Chenin Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier that was aged in older oak barrels. It has a broad smooth texture, a good layering of butter, spice and pear-tart flavors, and a lingering finish."
"Light, fresh and fruity without being at all sweet or soft, this is a charming dry wine to serve with lunch or at wine o'clock in the afternoon. It smell like freshly cut apples and Bosc pears, tastes crisp and feels tangy and palate cleansing."
"Light herb, sweet spice, orange peel, maple and red and black fruit aromas are followed by dark fruit flavors in this wine. It's a bit wound up now, so give it some time in the cellar or a long decant."
"Huckleberry, blackberry, coffee and bramble aromas lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It's appealing despite the heavy-handed oak."
"This is a herb-driven, savory and relatively light Syrah, with crushed thyme, marjoram and black peppercorns spicing up the elderberry jam aromas. The chaparral spices take center stage on the sip, where wild sage and oak forest undergrowth play against the dark fruit. Very quaffable."
"Flashes of buttery new oak show up in the lively aromas and richer flavors of this medium-bodied, barrel-fermented and elegant wine. It has a fine array of nutmeg, vanilla and lemon accents lifted by good acidity."
"Dry, light-bodied but not wimpy, this crisp wine has a great structure built from acidity and plenty of Granny Smith apple and white-peach flavors to keep it interesting. A touch of ripeness on the palate rounds out the texture and helps give it a lingering finish."
"This wine's apricot, spice and creamsicle scents are followed by tart, medium-bodied, lightly creamy fruit flavors. Tart citrus notes fill out the finish."
"Very jammy on the nose with fig and blackberry, this bottling of all the primary Bordeaux grapes except Cabernet Franc also shows aromatic hints of maple and bacon fat. It's very full on the sip, with chalky, mouthcoating tannins and flavors of black cherry, cola and cocoa."
"Balsamic aromas of camphor, toasted oak and oak-driven spice take center stage in this wine. On the tightly wound palate, taut tannins enwrap Marasca cherry, cranberry, white pepper and clove flavors. It's balanced with bright acidity."
"Very light aromas of seared nectarine, wet stone, orange peels and gardenia show on the nose of this bottling from the Tooth & Nail team. Tangerine rinds, sea salt and Gala apple flesh show on the sip."
"This wine has an extra measure of creaminess in the texture while giving up floral, lightly spicy and wonderfully fruity flavors. There's no obvious oak influence, just ripe raspberry, strawberry and macerated black-cherry notes that softly coat the palate and cling to the finish."
"This complex and savory wine has a noticeably gold color, rather quiet aromas of light baking spices and blanched almonds, and then reserved oak, mineral and almond flavors on a soothingly broad texture. It has good presence on the palate and leaves a lingering finish."
"Whiffs of white tea and tropical fruit perfume this pretty, delicately concentrated Gewrztraminer. While full bodied and moderate in alcohol, it's brisk, almost ethereal style lends grace and refreshment. Drink now through 2018."
"Fresh doughy aromas, crisp citrus and apple flavors, and a light blanket of buttery nutty nuances make this a delicious and complex wine. It's light to medium in body, has a smooth texture and vivid fruit."
"Aromas of cotton candy, vanilla and strawberry jam are fluffy. In the mouth, this wine feels ripe and syrupy, with firm tannins. Medicinal flavors of cassis, chocolate and herbs finishes thick and saturated. Drink through 2023."
"A very light shade of hay in the glass, this bottling, which is rounded by 16% Smillon, shows poached pear, honeysuckle nectar, green plum and lime skin on the nose. There is a great sizzle of acidity to the sip, where Bosc pear, Pink Lady apple, lime zest and wet gravel make for a complex profile."
"Juicy, sweet honeydew and green plum flavors are cut by shards of piercing lime and lemon in this ripe, light-footed Riesling. Medium-sweet in style, it's a keenly balanced single-vineyard bottling that should improve well through 2021."
"Tangy, dry and fruity, this opens with enticing red berry and citrus aromas. Mirroring the nose, the lightly sparkling palate doles out strawberry, cranberry and orange zest notes alongside vibrant acidity."
"Compared to Wiemer's more fruity, floral bottlings this vintage, the Josef Vineyard is decidedly savory, showing pronounced notes of earth and herb. Semisweet in style, the palate offers concentrated doses of fresh white pear and tangerine as well. The finish lingers on dusty mineral tones."
"This is this winery's fourth vintage, and the promise is strong, as this is one of the better white wines to emerge from Southern California in recent years. Anjou pear rinds, lime and apple scents show on the slightly sour but very aromatic nose. The flavors are rounded with pear and lime, but the sharp and chalky texture is most compelling, making for a clean and crisp wine."
"This wine's tilled earth, coffee and black plum aromas waft out of the glass. The hearty, full-bodied palate doles out mature black cherry, licorice and baking spice flavors alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese initially distracts with reductive aromas, but bright plum, cherry and spice notes follow. The flavors are plush, with light, grippy tannins. A great value that goes down easy."
"This wood-aged wine comes from a single vineyard in Mercurey. It is lightly toasty with touches of apricot, a crisper edge of citrus and a mineral aftertaste. Drink the wine from 2018."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (33%), Merlot (33%), Petit Verdot (16%), Malbec (16%) and Cabernet Franc (2%) delivers high toned notes of cocoa, purple flower, green herb and plum, showing whiffs of volatility. The palate is velvety-smooth, with plentiful dark fruit and chocolate flavors backed by burly tannins. Give it time to stretch its legs."
"Inviting aromas of violet and ripe red-skinned berry take center stage in this wine. The lively, full-bodied palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors framed by velvety tannins and zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2020."
"Floral red-berry and cassis aromas are steady and fresh. In the mouth, this wine turns raw and jagged. Cranberry, currant and red-plum flavors show very little oak before a lean, powerful finish. This cool-vintage wine will last for years but probably not improve."
"Baking spice and smoky wood-grain aromas are classy but dominate fruit scents. This wine feels crisp and snappy, with hard tannins. Spicy, woody flavors match the nose and are backed by chocolate and berry fruit notes, carrying through to the spicy, oaky finish."
"Very crisp, very lean, and very lively, this wine is driven by great fruit acidity and has a refreshing lip-smacking blend of tart apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors. It will be an attention-getting drink before dinner."
"Ripe berry, black cherry and leather aromas come together nicely in front of a creamy palate with just enough acid-tannin tension. Lightly herbal, spicy blackberry flavors are savory rather than dark and fruity. The wine tastes spicy and peppery on a finish that feels right."
"A selection from a single plot of 40- to 70-year-old vines, this full-bodied wine is juicy with a tight texture that comes from the terroir. It offers a crisp edge as well as bright acidity, the apple fruits lifted further by a lemon streak. Drink from 2019."
Citrus aromas reveal this wine's essentially crisp character. Plenty of acidity balances the rich white fruits while the mineral texture adds bite to this well-made wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019.
"Aromas of graphite, black olive, dark chocolate and herbal berry fruits get this Petit Verdot off on the right foot. In the mouth, high acidity makes for palate sharpness while also jacking up plum and currant flavors. A spicy, herbal-tasting finish runs long due to raw acidity."
"This ripe, spicy wine offers apple, pear and apricot flavors, giving ripeness and warm juicy acidity. The wine is smooth and rounded, with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now."
"With a hot-pink color and aromas like a light red wine, this ros has enough heft in the texture and complexity of flavor to substitute for a Pinot Noir or Sangiovese at lunch or dinner. It's medium bodied, has red-cherry and raspberry flavors and a smooth rather than crisp mouthfeel."
"This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The fruit is dominated by the high toast flavors needing time to integrate into the blueberry fruit flavor. That will happen, allowing this crisp, balanced wine to shine. Drink from 2020."
"There are extreme amounts of citrus on the nose of this bottling, particularly reminiscent of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, as well as an edgy, crushed slate minerality. The grapefruit character explodes on the sip, which is very refreshing, unique and compelling."
"Menthol, camphor, pressed violet, crushed herb and toast aromas come together in this wine. The solid, chewy palate delivers crushed raspberry, red cherry, espresso, star anise and toast flavors alongside firm tannins."
"This dense, savory wine has tobacco, black-skinned berry and red plum aromas and licorice, blackberry jam and black pepper flavors. Fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink through 2022."
"This bottling is fruit-forward on the nose with aromas of black currant and black plum, but the touches of dark chocolate and roasted game provide depth. It tightens up on the sip, where the blackberry-jam elements are enhanced by vanilla and milk chocolate shavings. The tannins are present but soft, and the acidity is decent, making for a very drinkable expression."
"This textbook Barbera opens with classic varietal aromas of dark berry, blue flower and ground spice. The vibrant, full-flavored palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and licorice notes alongside fresh acidity and smooth tannins. It's made for sheer drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon."
"This blend of 49% Syrah, 27% Cabernet Franc and 24% Cabernet Sauvignon leads with boysenberry, blackberry and sweet spice aromas, followed by full-bodied, lush fruit flavors. The tannins are a bit tacky, but it's otherwise appealing, showing pleasant balance."
"This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young."
"This wine is tangy and zesty, with a strong mineral texture that partners with the perfumed acidity, lively fruitiness and citrus flavors. It is likely to age well because of its tight texture. Drink from 2020."
"This Cte Chalonnaise appellation has done well in 2015 with its broad, ripe wines. This wine has the same character, with touches of wood and concentration from old vines. It is rich, the yellow fruits cut with some acidity. Drink this full, ripe wine wine from 2019."
"No-frills berry and cassis aromas open this Cabernet. A wide, jammy palate is generous but a touch off-centered. An aggressive herbal plum flavor leads the charge, while a tannic, grabby finish brings it home."
"This is a delicious, crisp wine full of minerality, acidity and a zesty texture. Tight and lively, it offers citrus and green-plum fruitiness with a hint of spice. Drink this attractive wine now."
"Lightly charred aromas of coffee, wood smoke and chocolate outweigh berry and plum scents. A tight palate shows firm tannins and carries roasted berry and plum flavors."
"Elegant notes of fresh herb and violet perfume this ripe, richly composed red. While full bodied and densely concentrated with red fruit, it shows restraint and balance, framing luscious fruit against firm, gripping tannins and a brisk, acidic edge."
"This spicy, toasty wine currently shows more wood than fruit. Hints of yellow fruits are already there, so the texture should open to give a riper, fruitier wine. Give it until 2020."
"Stark acidity and vibrantly fresh apple and lemon flavors lend vitality to this traditional-method sparkling made entirely from Chardonnay. Fine, persistent bubbles build into a delicate foam on the palate. The finish is marked by a hint of earthen complexity."
"The gold color and buttery flavors give this wine a rich personality for such a low-alcohol level and for a varietal that is often crisp and light. Almost mainstream in style compared to most D&G offerings, it has vanilla, pear and almond to add complexity and a smooth broad texture that soothes the palate."
"Dark, briary black-fruit aromas are a little wild but generally well focused. This Syrah displays an iron grip and power throughout. Spicy black-fruit flavors end with toasty oak. Overall, this is dense like an anvil, with a low center of gravity."
"Straight down-the-middle aromas of red cherry, salt and pepper, vanilla and a touch of brioche show on this bottling of a clone that's related to the Brunello region. It's lighter bodied on the palate and quite easy to quaff, with light cherry and strawberry flavors riding a gravelly texture."
"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot and 5% Carmenre is fragrant, with raspberry, freshly sliced bell pepper and green herb notes. The palate is full of cocoa and chocolate flavors, leaning heavily on oak attributes but still providing appeal."
"Traces of charred oak in the aroma and a flood of extremely ripe dark-fruit flavors come with a sense of depth and concentration in this full-bodied, very firm and tannic but nevertheless polished wine. This is higher in alcohol than the last two vintages reviewed. It will benefit from more age or a high-protein pairing."
"Millbrook's unoaked Chardonnay shares much of the luscious tropical fruit and fleshy mouthfeel of the oaked bottling, but without the embellishment of oak maturation. It's still quite a creamy, indulgent sip with a lingering lactic finish."
"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal."
"Citrus and light herb aromas turn to slightly more buttery, spicy flavors in this medium-bodied well-balanced wine. It has a good sense of richness in the mouthfeel along with hints of vanilla, cream and almond flavors to complement the fruit notes."
"This is a structured wine, with solid tannins as well as bright red fruits that are developing well. The structure and dry core will allow this single-vineyard wine to age well. Drink from 2019."
"This leads with forest floor, blue flower and black-skinned berry aromas while the structured, savory palate offers black cherry, red plum and Asian spice hints. Supple tannins and vibrant acidity provide easygoing support and freshness. Enjoy through 2021."
"Saline and sea breeze lend refreshing, nautical appeal to this elegant unoaked Chardonnay. It's plush and plump in mouthfeel but anchored by bracing lemon, tangerine and grapefruit flavors. Drink now through 2020."
"Floral red-fruit aromas show a touch of wild animal. The tight and choppy palate holds racy flavors of cherry and plum. A long, fruity finish rolls out little by little, with a lasting feel of grape skins."
"Firmly tannic and structured this is a young wine that will need time to soften. It has the foursquare character that is often found in Nuits Saint-Georges. The fruit weight is there, promising a ripe red-fruit future. The wine should be ready from 2020."
"Dill, crushed herb, oak, toast and balsamic aromas emerge in the glass as this wine opens. Its firm palate offers dried cherry, licorice and espresso flavors framed by close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. It has structure but lacks fruit richness."
"Cool mint, blueberry and raisin aromas are lush and smooth, but charred oak is roaring loud on the nose of this dry-farmed Syrah. Punchy, short acidity makes the mouthfeel abrupt. Dark chocolate and ripe berry flavors end with hard-spiced blackberry and an everlasting burnt-oak character."
"Ripe, sun-kissed plum and blackberry flavors are crisply balanced in this juicy, velvet-textured red. It's lavishly oaky, streaked with layers of spice, toast and caramel, but maintains elegance and brightness throughout. The finish is marked by fine-grained but penetrating tannins."
"Showing lots of lively citrus aromas, and crisp white-peach flavors, this wine tastes very refreshing. Blended from Grenache and other Rhne varietals, it's light in body, tangy in balance, and the fruit flavors hang in there on the finish."
"Impressively thick and dark for Joey Tensley's new entry-level brand, this wine's deep and dark aromas of slate-flecked soil makes for a very earthy impression on the nose, along with expected hints of tar, purple flowers and boysenberry. Condensed cassis flavors show on the sip along with hints of lavender and blueberry, laced together by soft tannins and an upright acidity."
"Menthol, violet, exotic spice and tobacco aromas take center stage in this wine. The firm palate shows red cherry, licorice and crushed herb flavors set against a backdrop of close-grained, grippy tannins."
"The 2015 vintage is a strong one for Woodbridge. Ripe fruit tones, bright acidity and lightly mouth-puckering tannins underpin red cherry, clove and blackberry flavors, while the texture is mouthfilling. It's a treat to find an inexpensive wine with such good backbone."
"White-fruit aromas and a prickly scent of cactus or nettle opens this tight, citrusy old-vines Verdejo. Matching the aromas, this tastes of pithy citrus, grapefruit and green herbs. A racy finish fades out nicely."
"Intense aromas of blackberry, violet and eucalyptus take shape in this. The juicy, concentrated palate doles out raspberry jam, ripe black cherry, clove and licorice flavors framed by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2022."
"Punchy citrus and tropical fruit aromas punctuate a stony, varietally correct nose. This Verdejo is slightly plump in feel, with penetrating acidity. Salty, briny apple and nectarine flavors finish clean and minerally."
"Briny aromas of cactus and lightly pickled cucumber are more neutral than loud. This is lively on the palate, with citrusy flavors that include a note of orange peel. Mild green-herb flavors and a touch of bitterness on the finish are not uncommon for Albario."
"Apple and mild citrus aromas are touched up by vanilla but also green notes of lettuce leaf. A citric, acid-driven palate delivers flavors of briny orange and grapefruit, while this wine feels healthy on a long finish."
"Brambly berry aromas are woody and a bit fiery. This roble feels sinewy, with structure and intensity. Black-fruit flavors are toasty but not charred or burnt. The finish is full and dark but short."
"Earthy, gamy aromas of blackberry and other berry fruits are meaty and sauvage. This Carmenre rings with acidity, lending a sense of raciness to the palate. Flavors of currant and plum are tart but also buttery, while an oak-infused finish is long lasting."
"Hailing from high in the Pyrenees, this wine dances to the beat of its own drummer. Floral red-fruit aromas suggest hot stones and wild brush, accompanying leather and tomato scents on this blend of Bordeaux grapes. A tight, tannic palate is home to herbal plum and tea flavors. The wine is earthy tasting but a bit muddled on the finish."
"A mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022."
"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows peach, melon, apple and key lime pith, which cuts through the riper elements. A simmering acidity is ever present on the sip, hewing the tropical guava flavors and providing a refreshing tension."
"Light, clear aromas of white fruits and lime offer notes of yeast and vanilla cookie. This wine is citric and tangy on the palate, with tangerine and lime flavors and a minerally finish."
"Vibrant diesel, orange rind, white flower and dried apricot aromas lead to dry stone fruit flavors in this wine. It shows a pleasant balance and persists through the finish."
"This wine leaves no doubt about the variety, with its freshly peeled orange and jasmine notes. The palate is sweet yet not cloying, with impeccable balance. For those looking for a well-priced sweet wine, look no further."
"This well-made full-bodied wine exudes a juicy core of red currant, cranberry and vanilla as a persistence of tannin provides power and wooded support. Oak and cedar play nicely together and add a wealth of savory concentration."
"This combines 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec. Its baking spice, black fruit and herb aromas are followed by silky-smooth dark fruit flavors that linger on the finish."
"Kiwi and lemon-lime aromas lead to a tight, stony palate. White-fruit flavors are more savory and briny than pure, while this evaporates and finishes with elegance. For a fresh style of cava, this brut nature rings true."
Old vines on the Aegerter Domaine in Savigny-ls-Beaune give a rounded ripe wine. It has a crisper red-cherry side to its otherwise smooth texture. The tannins support all this juicy fruit and offer a chance for the wine to age. Drink from 2020.
Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024.
Wood aromas provide a toasty character that dominates the fruit. It will take time for the apple and pear fruit flavors to show. Drink from 2020.
This still-young wine is jammy while firmly structured with dry tannins. There is a foursquare character that misses subtlety with its broad-brush approach. The wine does need to age and will be ready to drink from 2023.
"While the wine is fruity, it does have a bitter edge that comes from the toasty wood aging. Red-berry fruits have potential, offering a future when this bitter edge will go. Wait until 2021."
"While rounded and rich, this wine also has a tight structure that gives it concentration and minerality. Plenty of fruit and texture will allow the wine to age further. Drink from 2018."
"Bold strokes of yellow peach and tangerine get a jolt of electric acidity in this squeaky-clean, off-dry Riesling. Fresh and fruity, it's a mouthwatering white to enjoy now through 2019."
"Pale pink in color, this primarily Grenache- and Cinsault-based ros (which also has five other grapes involved) shows light watermelon, orange rind and crushed chalk on the nose. There is buoyant citrusy energy to the sip, which goes down incredibly easy."
"With fruit from Funk, Dugger Creek and Watermill Estate vineyards, this delivers funky peat, olive and fresh tobacco aromas. The flavors are light, soft and palate-coating, gliding into the finish. A subtle rendition of the variety."
"Spicy tangerine peels perfume this intense, full-bodied Gewrztraminer. It's richly textured, almost creamy, in mouthfeel but balanced brightly in acidity. Hints of fennel and pollen pepper a pleasantly phenolic finish."
"Elegant aromas of black plum, asphalt, black tea and sandalwood show on the nose of this appellation blend from Adam Lee. The palate offers hints of forest floor with mushroom and mulberry flavors, as well as a persistent woody spice."
"Resiny, woody oak aromas sit atop full-volume wild berry scents. This wine is plump, oaky and soft on the palate, with spicy berry flavors. Wood spice flavors dominate the finish, especially after the fruit has hit the road."
"This has black-skinned berry, mocha and tilled soil aromas. The concentrated palate doles out blackberry, clove and anise flavors alongside fresh acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2021."
"The distinct smell of fresh asphalt along with leather, burnt coffee, charred oak and black cherry make up the nose. In the mouth, this wine is wiry and acidic. Spiced black-plum flavors are peppery, riding a beam of acidity on a finish that could use more weight and tannins for balance. Drink through 2024."
"Oaky aromas of bacon and ham blend with vanilla on the nose of this plump, melony wine. Flavors of resiny oak, Animal Cracker cookies and melon turn overtly spicy on the finish that includes a hint of clove."
"Unusual but not unpleasant aromas of cinnamon and coffee cake lead to a saturated palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of fig paste, chocolate and baking spices confirm the wine's ripeness, while blackened flavors and rock-hard tannins drive the finish."
"This traditional Bordeaux-style blend offers loads of bright blackberry and cherry flavors accented by notes of dark toast, coconut and spice. Moderately concentrated on the palate, it's juicy yet firmly structured. The finish is marked by bold, dense tannins."
"A tight beam of oak and char runs through prune, blackberry and cassis aromas. This Somontano Syrah feels tight like a fist, with rough tannins and bright acidity. Peppery oak and black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal and spicy on a snappy finish that doesn't lay down. Drink through 2019."
"Vanilla, herb, cherry, coconut and barrel spice aromas are followed by supple cherry and spice flavors in this wine. The barrel influence is a bit up-front, but it still provides plenty of pleasure."
"This wine's exotic spice, leather, toast and vanilla aromas unfold in the glass. The taut, linear palate offers dried black cherry and pomegranate flavors, with a sprinkling of cinnamon, assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity."
"A touch of green pepper dances on the nose of this otherwise bold, darkly fruited wine. Notes of coffee and brownie lend richness to the palate, fleshing out the crushed-velvet texture and black plum and currant flavors. A final hit of tobacco spice graces the finish."
"Bold gooseberry, honeydew and citrus flavors abound on this squeaky-fresh and fruity Albario. It's plump in body but dry and zesty in style. This is a forward, easy-guzzling wine that highlights fresh fruit but finishes with a whisper of sea-salt minerality."
"This wine's matchstick, dark fruit, vanilla, herb and spice aromas are brooding. It's full and rich on the palate, with dark fruit flavors that linger on the finish."

"Violet, red berry and crushed herb aromas lead the nose while the juicy, fruity palate doles out wild cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper notes. Crisp acidity lends a clean finish."

Forest-driven flavors power the palate, where firm but forgiving tannins present black cherry and dark chocolate shavings."

"This leads with aromas suggesting freshly picked violet, toast, espresso, menthol and crushed herb. The vibrant palate delivers Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, coffee bean and licorice flavors in a frame of youthfully assertive tannins."
"Dark, rubbery aromas are offset by a floral berry component. Grabby tannins are a big part of this Cabernet's chunky palate. Flavors of hickory, caf mocha and roasted berry fruits finish chocolaty and with residual tannins."
"Produced from vines close to the chateau of Santenay, this is a tight, mineral wine. It has intense crisp acidity, tangy citrus and excellent potential. The fruit is asking for time to fill out, so drink from 2018."
"This wine's aromas are locked up but still show nuance, with fresh herb, flower, vanilla, chocolate and cherry notes. The palate shows restraint despite the warm region and vintage, with firm, lightly dry tannins providing support. It shows well at the dinner table."
"This delivers smoke, coffee bean, dark red fruit and spice aromas. It's oak-forward on the palate, somewhat obscuring the fruit flavors, but it still brings appeal."
"Showing a dry character from the wood aging, this spicy wine also has fruit weight. While it is still young, its ripe berry flavors laced with black cherries are right up front. It does have the rounded character of a Beaune and this will develop more strongly. Drink from 2021."
"Aromas of white peach and apple come with mild oak notes. This feels melony and full, with its body weight dictated by tropical fruits. Briny, salty tropical fruit and corn flavors finish with a lasting note of oak."
"This wine's aromas are bright and fruit forward, with generous black pepper, raspberry, fresh flower, smoked meat and barrel spice notes. The full-bodied palate delivers cranberry flavors that are appealing but more ponderous than the aromas might suggest."
"This wine's aromas are fruit forward, suggesting cantaloupe, melon and pear. The palate is spicy and broad, bringing a lot of appeal."

"This fresh, lively and assertive wine comes off as a touch sweet but it has such tangy acidity that it stays well balanced. Bright cherry and raspberry flavors have a big impact on the palate and will help it pair nicely with strong foods."
"This drinks like a Port, with extremely ripe and definitely sweet flavors of raisins, dried plums and blackberry jam. It's not so much a dinner wine as something to sip around the campfire or with a dark chocolate dessert."
"Tropical-fruit aromas are slightly oily but on target for Verdejo. This wine displays a full, round palate held together by acidity and white-fruit tannins. Lightly salty grapefruit flavors finish moderately long, with citrus overtones. Drink as soon as possible."
"Yellow peach, lemon, Asian pear and citrus peels show on the nose of this bottling by Matt Villard. It's very light and reserved on the palate, which is what makes it refreshing, with flavors of ripe nectarine, pan-seared apple and cider. A sizzle of acidity runs through it."
"Black-skinned berry, tilled soil and baking spice aromas lead the way in this wine. Made from very old vines, it delivers blackberry, star anise and clove flavors alongside round tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy through 2021."
"Pellegrini's standard-label Chardonnay offers a brightness and vibe that stands out against the winery's oakier Vintner's Blend. There's ample toast and spice here, but it's deftly applied, highlighting the wine's rich, slightly leesy texture. Fresh acidity lends balance and grace. Drink now through 2020."
The wine has delicious acidity as well as lively fruitiness. An attractive mineral texture offers a tangy view of a ripe vintage. Drink this crisp wine now.
"Rich tropical fruits are balanced by attractive acidity in this full, mineral-textured wine that's ripe and crisp at the same time. Drink this attractive, balanced wine now."

"Cola, root beer and Red Hots candy play against strawberry, pomegranate and damson on the nose of this playful Pinot Noir. Rusty cranberry, tart red plums and a bit of garrigue spice play on the palate."
"Raspberry and plum aromas are fresh and inviting. A full, fresh, popping palate is lively, while a cross of cherry, raspberry and citrus flavors is whetting and tasty. A zesty, steady finish confirms the fairly high quality."
"The nose on this appellation blend is plump and inviting, blending pan-seared Gala apples and browned butter with a more intriguing botanical aroma. There is zip on the tip of the sip, with flavors of lime peel, lemon zest and a nuttiness in the midpalate."
"This blend of 37% Grenache, 37% Syrah and 26% Mourvdre is brooding, with its char, smoke, cranberry, dark plum and woodspice aromas. On the palate, silky black cherry flavors are accented with barrel-derived notes, striking a lovely balance."

"This boasts violet, red-skinned berry and white pepper aromas. The juicy palate delivers strawberry, red cherry and anise notes against a backdrop of round tannins and refreshing acidity. Drink through 2020."
"This leads with truffle, underbrush, pressed violet and camphor scents. The taut, linear palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, licorice, sage and orange peel notes alongside bracing tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it a few more years for the tannins to unwind then drink."
"This wine's apple, melon and pear aromas are bright and appealing. The flavors are taught and focused, with a light creaminess and lemony acidity. It's interesting overall, providing both quality and value."
"This wine's fragrant blue flower and red berry aromas lift out of the glass. On the savory palate, ground clove accents raspberry jam and wild cherry notes, all hemmed in with refined tannins."

"This is a tight, tangy wine, laced with attractive wood flavors. Plenty of crisp citrus and spicy flavors balance each other. It is already delicious, so drink now."
"With its juicy, concentrated peach, nectarine and apple flavors, the Clbre is Dr. Frank's more approachable, easy-going sparkling. It's fruity, forward and delicately sweet yet maintains steadfast acidity and a soft, foamy mouthfeel."
"This wine is tight and closed up. It does suggest plenty of fruit weight, hinting at toast and apple flavors that will come through over the next several years to give a rich wine. Drink from 2022."

"Dark red fruit, cracked pepper and the slightest hint of green herbs show on the nose of this pleasant bottling. The herb character is well integrated into a firmly tannic frame on the sip, where tart Montmorency cherry and black-plum skins mix with milk chocolate flavors. The tannins are sticky, yet the mouthfeel is soft in the midpalate."
"With no wood aging, the fruit speaks in this wine. However, it does have tannins and a stalky, young character, along with generous black-cherry fruit and a touch of spice. The wine needs to age a few months more, so drink from 2018."
"Smooth, floral berry aromas are easy to like. This crianza feels whole and plump. Lightly herbal tomato flavors blend with richer plum and berry notes in front of a balanced, mostly ripe finish."
"An extreme aroma of heavily toasted oak carries through to the intense smoky, meaty flavors of this full-bodied and quite tannic wine that was aged in 80% American oak and 20% French. It's rowdy and robust, but fun to drink for fans of no-holds-barred oakiness."
"This is a wonderful, relatively light wine for the varietal. It smells beautifully floral, tastes spicy, complex and full of berries, and calms the tannin down to a smooth, supportive level. Still, it packs a punch and will make a good change of pace when the evening calls for a full-bodied red."
"Prickly, cool aromas of herbal berry fruits and eucalyptus open this wine. It's dense, tannic and chewy, with dark black-fruit flavors along with herbal notes and tobacco. A meaty, almost salty finish is tannic as nails, so let this breathe as much as possible before drinking."
"A light color and classic aromas of white flowers, citrus blossom and wet stones open this dry Moscatel from Mlaga. A lean, crisp palate with lime-like acidity deals flavors of lime, lychee and white pineapple. A low-volume but racy finish is fresh and tangy."
"This 100% varietal wine shows raspberry jam, fruit leather and plum aromas that are bright on the nose. The palate packs tart fruit flavors supported by plump, ripe tannins. It's not your typical Cabernet but still provides appeal, though the alcohol dominates at times."

"This wine's aromas suggest woodspice, herb, parsley, cherry and smoke. Its cherry and coffee flavors are light in style and cut short on the finish."
"Browned butter, toasted almonds, sea salt and peach blossoms converge for a compelling nose on this twist-top appellation blend. It's a full Chardonnay on the sip, with Meyer lemon peel, Gala apple and savory sea salt, all cut by a racy line of acidity."
"Elderberry, white pepper, leather, asphalt and black olive show on the nose of this blend of all five Bordeaux varieties done in the region's savory style. The flavors are mellow overall, with wildfire smoke and a bit of herbaceousness decorating the elderberry and graphite core."
"There is a very tarry, somewhat reductive power that persists long after opening this blend of 75% Syrah and 25% Petite Sirah, which somewhat masks the blackberry, brioche and fudge touches. The palate shows tart black plum and gravel, and is still very tightly woven. Expect this to improve in the months and years to come."
"Slightly rustic, meaty aromas of berry fruits are savory and include notes of iodine and dried blood. This feels a bit hard, raw and rubbery, but leathery dark-fruit flavors are quite good. On the finish, rubbery tannins return. Drink through 2019."
"Star anise, camphor and toast aromas lead the nose of this wine. The firm palate shows red cherry, crushed strawberry and chopped mint flavors alongside fine-grained tannins."
"This juicy Albario opens like a bowl of fresh fruit, with aromas of apple, pear, peach and melon. Stone-fruit and citrus flavors are slightly pithy and oily in character, while tangy orange and pineapple echo on a brief but clean finish."
"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling."
"Aromas of orange blossom, clover and honey are true to sun-dried Moscatel grapes. This feels thick and chunky on the palate, but also a bit soft and flat. Flavors of honey and brown sugar are creamy, with modest acidic cut. A slightly cloying finish continues that theme."
"This is a well-balanced medium-bodied wine that has everything in good proportion. The aromas are lightly fruity, like green apples, the tangy apple flavors are touched with of fresh herbs, and the texture is fresh and crisp."
"Vanilla, bright herb, cocoa, cassis and spice aromas lead to plentiful coffee and cherry flavors in this wine. The tannins are a bit gritty."
"This Cabernet Sauvignon's char, vanilla, caramel, toast, herb and dark fruit scents are followed by equal parts fruit and barrel flavors. It delivers enjoyment notwithstanding the heavy oak influence, which may yet integrate in the bottle."
"This wine's aromas bring cherry and chocolate to mind. The palate provides pleasing fruit and barrel notes, but the two seem disconnected."
"The small Beaujolais cru of Chnas is next door to Moulin  Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019."
"This is a generous wine, finely balanced and with great fruit. It has a touch of spice to balance the lively acidity and green crisp fruits. A waft of Mediterranean herbs passes over this ripe, generous wine. Drink from late 2017."
"This wine's chopped herb, dark culinary spice, eucalyptus and oak aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers raw cherry, ground clove, star anise and tobacco set against close-grained tannins that grip the finish."
"Very dark in color, this robust wine has enticing wood smoke and oak aromas, rich but dry fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry, an abundance of muscular tannins in the firm texture and full but not overpowering body. It's very tight to drink now, so best consume it after 2022."
"It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price. Spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg precede vivid and ripe fruit flavors and more of those oaky spices on the palate where firm tannins and a bite of acidity give a mouthwatering balance."
"Light cherry, turned earth, rust and potpourri aromas show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, which is exploring the lower end of the alcohol scale. The sip is very light and pleasant although a bit simple, with light cherry juice and tangy red plum most prominent."
"Made from organic grapes, this bright red opens with violet, red-skinned berry and white pepper scents. The juicy palate doles out ripe raspberry, red cherry and star anise notes, with fresh acidity and velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
"This is a smooth-textured and well-balanced wine. It smells a little smoky, but tastes moderately crisp and tannic, with ripe fruit favors to balance out the tartness."
"Light dried orange peel, herb and candlewax aromas lead to broad, medium-bodied fruit flavors in this white. It's enjoyable despite the muted aromatic expression."

"Crisp and bright, this wine has retained plenty of acidity even in this ripe vintage. Attractive and spicy, it offers citrus fruits as well as apricots. Drink now."
"Despite its moderate alcohol, this dry, full-bodied Pinot Gris feels quite plush and plump. Ripe white peach and apricot flavors are honeyed in tone, off set by fresh acidity and a slightly steely finish."
"A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes."
"Velvety smooth, and brimming with ripe berry flavors, this wine feels broad and rich on the palate, carrying flavors like black plums and boysenberry jam. So ripe it's almost sweet, the wine is nothing if not generous and fruity. A 7% addition of Port-style sweet wine gives it that extra dimension."
"This brand reliably produces varietally correct, down-the-middle wines, and this is no exception, starting with aromas of Anjou pear, underripe honeydew, tight white-flower buds and freshly cut key lime. The ripe stone-fruit flavors on the sip are cut by citrus and wet cement, offering all the elements to please many a Sauv Blanc fan."
"Light and lean on entry, this wine builds up steam and power as it develops in the glass, becoming a robust exploration of rhubarb and cranberry. The texture on the palate is velvety and moderately rich, dotted in sultry spice."
"Dominated by red-currant fruits, this is a soft wine with tannins in the background. It has a toasty edge from the wood aging while leaving most of the singing to the fruit. Drink from 2021."
"Solid white-fruit aromas blend with a grassy note of hay as well as dusty floral scents. A smooth mouthfeel is devoid of edginess, while friendly white peach, melon and apple flavors are round on the finish."

Oak meets with roasted nuts, sea salt, pecan brittle and Gravenstein apple on the nose. The rounded palate shows sandalwood, candied walnuts and chamomile, though oak is very prominent as well."
"This blend of 57% Marsanne, 40% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc manages to be very light and crisp on the nose, with aromas of underripe nectarine and apricot as well as lemon peels and crushed white rocks. There is a defined grip to the sip, with lemon and nectarine flavors."

"This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenre, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together. Dry tannins back up its blue and black fruit flavors."
"This is an untamed traditional-style wine that is tannic to its core and may require 20 years to reach its peak of enjoyment. It has aromas of blackberry and black pepper, flavors of espresso and bitter chocolate and a titanic structure built with layer after layer of muscular tannins that leave quite an astringent effect on the finish. Best after 2025."

"This wine has a firm structure as well as plenty of fruit. The wine's acidity, crisp red-currant fruit and bright character are balanced by the firm, smoky and dry tannins. Give this structure time to soften and fill out into a ripe wine. Drink from 2019."
"For this appellation, this is a soft wine, full of bright cherry flavors and attractive acidity. A jammy character brings out rich fruitiness that will allow the wine to be ready from 2018."
"This opens with spiced blueberry, red plum and tilled earth aromas while the medium-bodied palate doles out blackberry, black cherry and clove flavors. Fine-grained tannins and firm acidity provide support. Drink through 2020."
"Aromas of creamy vanilla and mixed berry fruits are a bit jumbled. This has a full, grabby, chunky palate, with spicy plum and peppery flavors that don't show a lot of variation or complexity. On the finish, there's heat and oak to cut through."
"Malty, earthy, roasted berry aromas become more chocolaty as this wine breathes. An oaky, resiny palate is saturated and shows spicy, peppery black-fruit flavors along with some heat. This Bobal-Merlot blend sizzles on a full-throttle finish that's not shy on oak."
"This wine's citrus zest and honeysuckle aromas seem a bit light for the variety. It drinks off dry, with fleshy stone fruit flavors."
"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, graphite, plum, herb, anise, char and blackberry are followed by dark fruit flavors in this wine, which shows appealing restraint."
"There's an intriguing touch of peanut brittle as well as underripe berries, rose petals and roasted game on the nose of this blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 20% Carignane. The palate offers dried cranberry and tar flavors."
"This combines fruit from Ferguson (60%) and Seven Hills vineyards to deliver barrel spice, clove, raspberry and mineral scents. The palate is medium bodied and full of chewy, slightly dry tannins. The oak shows prominently at present, needing more time in bottle to integrate."
"This highly demanding coastal Syrah is intense from start to tail. Aromas of wet cement, eucalyptus and saucy, herbal tomato and plum are anything but easy. It feels extracted and tough. Saucy flavors of herbal black plum and tomato are on the green spectrum, finishing spunky and toasty. Drink through 2022."
"Slightly foxy red-berry and plum aromas are spicy and a touch earthy. A wide, blocky palate is trying hard to stay in line, but this Malbec weighs in on the heavy side. Flavors of toasty, minty blackberry finish with chocolate and spice notes."
"This leads with violet, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while red cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors mark the savory palate. Smooth tannins and bracing acidity provide balance. Enjoy through 2020."

"There are very ripe aromas of kirsch, cassis, licorice and root beer on the nose of this bottling, which begin to evolve into prunes, dried figs and raisins with time. The cola spice flavor is strong as are the prune and milk chocolate, all of which ride a strong tannic frame."
"This delicately carbonated Riesling sparkler offers all of the grape's characteristic aromatic exuberance. It's blossomy and plump in notes of sweet peach, apple and lemon, yet bristling and spry. An easy going, light-bodied sip for everyday enjoyment."
"Whiffs of smoky crushed slate lend some mineral depth to this light-bodied, medium-sweet Riesling. It's a deftly balanced wine offering zippy tangerine, lemon and lime tinged by a reverberating streak of honey."
"This ripe, full-bodied wine is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Although rich, it has enough acidity to keeps it crisp and fruity. The wine is balanced and delicious, ready to drink now."

This wine is tight and flinty. Crisp lemon and apple flavors are textured with a steely character that needs time to broaden out. Drink this mineral wine from 2019.
"A mineral-driven wine, this is tangy-zesty, with a tight texture. Great fruit shines through the crispness. Balanced, ripe and with some potential, the wine will be ready from late 2018."
"Floral berry aromas are drowned out by heavy scents of licorice and clove. A jumpy, fresh palate is raw but high in energy. Herbal, minty currant flavors are dry, oaky and toasty on the finish. This blend is made from six grapes, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon among them."
This blend of Horse Heaven Hills and Red Mountain fruit delivers brooding cherry and herb aromas and full-bodied black cherry flavors. The tannins contribute grit.

Apple and vanilla-cookie aromas are mild. The slightly chunky mouthfeel suggests grape skins. Skins-driven flavors of lime and grapefruit finish with an oily texture and a taste of citrus peel.
"This wine's red and yellow apple and melon aromas lead to broad, fleshy fruit flavors. It's direct and delivers a lot of appeal."
"Vanilla, cocoa, barrel spice and herb aromas are followed by creamy fruit and barrel flavors. The vanilla notes overwhelm the nose and palate, however, distracting from the fruit."
"Ripe, lifted blackberry and plum notes are tinged with game and garrigue in this luscious, full-bodied Meritage. An unusual dose of Carmenre lends an earthy, savory character that balances an otherwise plush, fruity palate. The finish is framed with fine, soft tannins and a lingering spice note."
"This Verdejo is pungent and angular on the nose, with pyrazinic aromas of green citrus, sweat and cactus that are common to the variety and Rueda. An oily, grabby palate is cut by firm acidity, while flavors of tangerine, nopal and bell pepper finish short despite lively acidity."
"Richly barrel fermented, this wine shares its caramelized toasty oak character with sultry, creamy ripe apple, pear and melon. Lushly layered, it goes spicy on the finish in a dash of piquant nutmeg."
"This shows vanilla, clove, barrel spice and dark fruit aromas. Its fruit flavors are full and laced with upfront barrel notes. It seems a little boozy."
"This leads with aromatic herb, wild berry and oak-driven spice notes. The tight, taut palate offers licorice, clove, baking spice, crushed sage and dried black cherry flavors but lacks fruit richness. It's framed by firm, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity."
"This is a full and creamy wine. The richness is happily cut with citrus and apple acidity to give a crisp edge and tang to the ripe yellow fruit. It finishes with a lively, bright aftertaste."
"Apple and pear aromas are clean as a whistle. This is varietal Xarello, a key grape in Cava production. It is citrusy and minerally in feel, with lemon, tangerine and stony flavors mixed with a touch of yeast. A tight, exact finish is juicy and stony."
"More floral and ethereal than the producer's reserve bottling, this delicately concentrated Gamay suggests juicy, crisp red cherries and strawberries. It's a pretty, subtly structured wine with softer, yielding tannins."
"This wine hints at some of the power and structure of this famous grand cru. But it is power reflected through a glass darkly, with its red-berry fruits, tannins and acidity all indistinct. The wine is likely to be ready to drink from 2018."
"Truffle, stewed prune, pressed violet and camphor aromas lead the way in this wine. The palate is somewhat evolved, showing cooked fruit, licorice and baking spice hints alongside firm but rather fleeting tannins. Drink sooner than later."
"Spicy, briary berry aromas lead to a full palate that's slightly clipped. Short, peppery blackberry flavors come with a note of bitterness. This wine is toasty, oaky and tastes a bit like tomato sauce on the finish."
"This wine's black-skinned berry, cooking spice and violet aromas drift out of the glass while the racy palate offers ripe black cherry and cranberry jam flavors with a touch of clove. Brisk acidity and supple tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020."
"Broad aromas of Asian pear, kaffir lime and wet stone show on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard located just minutes from the sands of Pismo Beach.

"There's a honeyed tone to this medium-sweet Riesling that is light on its feet with spine-tingling acidity. Earthier elements of crushed stone and saffron lend subtle nuance to juicy grapefruit, lime and green apple. Easy going and fresh, it should be enjoyed young through 2019."
"Aromas of yeasty pastry, powdered sugar and apple pie come prior to a nervy palate with a mix of tropical melon and papaya flavors along with salad-like garden notes. Flavors of green herbs are prominent on the finish."
"Made from Cinsault grapes, this is a reductive, salty and somewhat intense wine at first, that settles nicely into developed flavors of ripe strawberry, peach and vanilla. With substantive weight and breadth, it offers a pleasing texture and body without ever getting bogged down. This is a fine wine for the table."
"Snappy, prickly citrus and green aromas are typical of cool-climate Leyda Sauvignon Blanc. This feels light and a bit watery, but entirely fresh. Flavors of grapefruit, gooseberry, celery and scallion stay around for the finish."
"Oaky aromas blend with notes of root beer, coffee grounds and lightly stewed berry fruits. This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Carmenre and Merlot. It's a bit grabby and rough in feel, while flavors of cheesy oak and herbal berry fruits finish hard and tannic."
"Grapes are sourced from the producer's Grace Benoist Ranch, among other sites, including Emeritus Vineyard in the Russian River Valley. It shows a warm-climate character of rich, robust cherry cola, generous oak and tannin, with the profile made fruity by layers of strawberry and dried herb."
"This appellation blend shows black raspberry, crushed violets and cola on the dark and brooding but well-balanced nose. The sip is a bit more simple than the winery's single vineyard offerings, but shows easily enjoyable flavors of plum, boysenberry and white pepper."
"Spring blossom and ginger notes perfume this pretty, aromatic Pinot. Crisp red cherry and cranberry notes are zesty on the palate, accented by hints of leaf and herb. Full bodied yet crisply composed, it finishes with delicate, fine-grained tannins."
"Fresh, inviting and pleasant aromas of key lime pie, grapefruit rind, lemon peels and a bit of cut grass show on the nose of this bottling from a winery that is leading an Albario interest in the Paso Robles area. There is a lot of bouncy acidity to the palate that rides through riper Anjou pear and Gala apple flavors, with tart and tangy lime zest as well."
"This wine's light cranberry, cherry and maple candy aromas show a bit of volatility. Full-throttle dark fruit flavors follow, coating the palate from end to end. It pulls no punches and shows some heat on the finish."
"Blended from Grenache, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine has smoky charred-wood aromas, and tastes dry and powerful, with very firm tannins. It's lean in terms of fruit flavor, but it has a great grippy texture to pair well with big proteins."
"This opens with French oak, vanilla, toast and coconut aromas. The oak-derived qualities carry over to palate, along with sour cherry, raspberry compote and espresso flavors while tight, close-grained tannins grip the finish."
"This ripe Chardonnay is smooth, showing a subtle use of wood and good acidity to balance. Creamed apple and white peach are given brightness by the acidity. The wine is ready to drink."
"This wine is just over two-thirds Merlot, the balance in Syrah, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Dark plum, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and spice aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors backed by plump tannins. It goes down easy."
"This ripe wine is already delicious with its full, bold fruits and peach and mango flavors. It's full of rich fruits and touched lightly by spice. Drink this generous wine from 2018."

"This smooth wine has a rounded, soft texture, but acidity and a citrus edge creep into the peach and pineapple fruits. Drink now."

"Oily aromas of orange peel, orange blossom and wild flowers set up a slightly viscous palate. Flavors of pear, lychee and bitter melon barely hold up on a plump finish. Drink this aging Moscatel right away."
"This wine's raspberry, red apple, spice and red fruit aromas are bright. The flavors are ripe and full bodied, showing some heat."
The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits. It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021.
"This aromatic wine is delicious Pinot Noir. With fine ripe red fruits that are shot through with tannins for aging and crisp acidity for refreshing drinking, this is a rich wine that should be drunk now."
"This rounded wine is soft and ripe. Along with its smooth, warm texture it offers generous pear and melon flavors. Acidity adds an attractive final crispness. Drink now."

"This wine's tightly wound woodspice, black cherry, cocoa, caramel and herb aromas are followed by tart, plentiful dark fruit flavors. It needs some time for its chewy, lightly dry tannins to settle, but plenty of good things are going on. Give it some time in the cellar or a long decant."

"Clean aromas of nectarine and white peach meet with a touch of chalk, slight edge of lemon zest, sweet butter and sea salt on the nose of this bottling. There is a decent texture to the sip, where lemon, lime, toasted nuts and more sea-salt flavors show."
"Classic Provence pale-pink-colored ros, this is a soft red-fruit flavored wine. With bright acidity and a smooth texture, the wine is balanced. There is a touch of vanilla at the end to finish the wine easily."
"This is a very fresh medium-bodied wine that overflows with ripe raspberry and blackberry flavors. It's the opposite of a serious age-worthy wine, but wonderful to drink now for its effusive fruit flavors that come along with just enough tannin for support on the palate."
"Ripe berry aromas are heady. In the mouth, this hard-edged Cabernet is gritty and smacking. Ripe plum and blackberry flavors are backed by hefty but pulling tannins, and overall the texture is quite rough."
"It is not clear while a simple appellation Bourgogne should need a wax capsule and heavy bottle. It all makes it that much harder to get to the warm ripe wine inside. With its strawberry fruit that is laced with acidity, the wine is generous, reveling in the fine 2015 vintage. Drink from 2018."

"This opaque Carmenre opens with oaky, charred aromas of black fruits, coconut and burnt toast. The palate is full, meandering and ultimately heavy and extracted. Dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, resiny oak and vanilla finish with grabby tannins, spiky acidity and long-lasting blackened notes."
"Bright melon and lime zest aromas lead to lightly sweet, broad, fleshy fruit flavors in this wine. It's not entirely representative of the variety but still brings a lot of freshness and appeal."
"Aromas of field greens and wax bean are restrained on the nose. This has a round palate with citric acidity. Flavors of briny green fruits finish slightly closed and bitter. This wine reflects the 2016 vintage which was a cloudy, wet one in Casablanca."
"This inventive atypical blend of 50% Viognier, 47% Pinot Gris and 3% Chardonnay shows honeysuckle, mango and Gravenstein apple on the nose. There's a slightly sweet impression of ripe stone fruit at the start of the sip, but it tightens considerably onto a steely, chalky texture and more sour-lime flavors."

"This has earthy aromas suggesting underbrush, new leather, menthol and truffle, along with a whiff of medicinal herb. The palate is tightly wound and still rather closed, offering hints of espresso, anise and raw berry framed by drying, close-grained tannins."
"Bursts of pineapple, mango and melon lend a tropical air to this fruity carbonated Muscat. Medium-sweet and light as a feather, it's a fresh, easy-drinking fizz to enjoy on the porch or on a picnic."
"Wood and spice flavors add extra richness to an already-ripe wine. Opulent and full, it's laced with toast and warm mango and peach fruits. A wine to drink young, it's ready now."

"This shows light lime, green apple and herb aromas. It drinks dry, with abundant apple flavors supported by tart acidity."
"Stainless-steel fermented, this wine is made from grapes grown in Paso Robles and Lodi and is intensely concentrated. Pretty aromatics of honeysuckle open up before thick rich layers of lushly ripe peach flavor ride in."
"This ripe, smooth and lightly toasty wine is a rich product of this warm vintage for whites. Yellow and ripe melon fruits are balanced by sufficient crisp acidity to give the wine a bright edge. Drink from 2018."
Laurent Dufouleur is the current director of Tramier and has created a series of wines under his name. This wood and red-fruit-flavored wine is likely to be attractively ripe and jammy as the wood softens and integrates. There is fine acidity at the end and the wine will be ready to drink from 2019.
"Berry, vanilla, coconut and barrel spice aromas are followed by barrel flavors in this wine. It brings appeal, but the oak (42% new French and American) seems to take over."
"Savory pepper and rustic gravel aromas meet with strawberry and dried cherry on the nose of this proprietary red blend that is widely available. Strawberry pie flavors dominate the sip, but there's also a lava rock minerality and a burst of acidity."
"A pale pink in the glass, this light and clean bottling shows aromas of chalk, pink flowers, watermelon and a slice of lime. It's crisp on the sip with a tight texture, offering a very quaffable bubblegum flavor."

"This blend of 57% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 3% Mourvdre brings grilled asparagus, stewed fruit and black olive aromas. It's plush and palate-coating, but the aromas and flavors are out of sync."
"Hailing from the volcanic soils of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, this blend of Pedro Ximnez and Listn Blanco opens with aromas of citrus peel and honey. A powerful palate is angular and smacking. Salty citrus flavors reflect an ocean influence, while the wine is strong on the finish."
"Ripe fruit aromas show alongside an equally rich, creamy palate. This wine has attractive lemon and crisp apple flavors, touched by wood to give a smooth, rich aftertaste. Drink from 2018."

"Woodbridge makes two styles of Chardonnay, and this is the richer one. Attractive layering of fruit, cream and hazelnut flavors on a nicely viscous texture makes this full-bodied wine something special. It has a good sense of concentration and depth, along with a lingering finish."
"This widely available bottling by the Niven family is a very safe and reliable expression of Cab, with black plums, crushed slate, a touch of oak, some purple flowers and a little soy on the nose. The palate is also down the middle, with earth, wood and dark fruit all present, framed by strong acidity and firm but not overwhelming tannins."
"This leads with blue fruit aromas and follows with baking spice notes. The flavors are sweet, plump and undeniably appealing."
"Like all of Raul Bobet's Castell d'Encus wines from the Pyrenees, this Pinot Noir displays a personality all its own. Raspberry and strawberry aromas are floral and herbal, but feel chunky and a bit obtuse. Tea, herbal plum and Asian spice flavors end with notes of wild flowers and black tea."
"Extremely woody aromas of cedar meet with prunes, tobacco leaf and nutmeg on the nose of this bottling from a property south of San Jose. That woody character also plays powerfully on the palate, mixing with baked blueberry flavors to achieve a sort of balance. The tannins makes for a squeaky texture on the finish."
"Deeply colored and lightly effervescent, this offers black-skinned fruit and dark spice aromas. The refreshing palate doles out blackberry and cassis flavors, with a note of bitter almond."

"This vintage marks the winery's 45th anniversary making this wine, a feat of historic proportion. Maintaining a fair price, it offers lime, lemon and grapefruit within bristling, buzzing acidity. The texture is thick and refined. Balanced, it's dry and refreshing."
"This is a crisp fruity wine, full of red-berry fruits and acidity. It has the vintage's rich character, juicy and with a core of tannins that will soften quickly. Drink from 2020."
"Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit, though, is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024."
"This is a ripe, fruity wine from a village that also has vines in the Pouilly Fuiss appellation. Soft and rounded, it conveys apricot and melon flavors that are shot through with acidity. Drink the wine from 2018."
"Fresh and fruity without overdoing it, this medium-bodied wine has light notes of apple, banana, peach and cherry in the aromas and the flavors, and a good snappy texture to balance them out. Perfect for the cocktail hour."
"Pale salmon in color, this delivers mineral, strawberry and cherry aromas. It's dry on the palate, with tart, lightly concentrated sour cherry and citrus rind flavors."
"Lightly toasty notes lead the nose of this wine, along with herb, green apple and citrus rind aromas. The palate is quite elegant in style, needing only a bit more concentration to truly shine."
"Big but well balanced, this full-bodied wine has been tamed a bit by two-and-a-half years of aging, but it still has the typical firm tannins that cling to the sides of the mouth. Accents of cedar and earth accompany the tasty blackberry core of flavor."
"In the rush for white wines, it is sometimes forgotten that Chassagne-Montrachet once produced more red than white. This soft perfumed wine shows the generous nature of the wines from this appellation with red-cherry flavors coming from the Pinot Noir. Rich, soft and fruity, the wine will be ready from 2018."
"This is a mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top in terms of ripeness or tannins, so it's smooth to drink and offers mild plum and cherry flavors."

"Aromas of spicy oak and dried berry fruits lead to a clampy, rubbery palate. Plum and berry flavors are slightly saucy, while the finish, which is still fresh for a 2009, is tannic and pulling."
"There's an impressive amount of garrigue packed into this bottling, which is a bit light for the usually very dark grape, as well as touches of sandalwood, cedar and a gamy animal hide aromas. It's zippy on the sip with black raspberry and dark cranberry flavors plus thyme, pepper and sage."
"A mostly complete mix of apple, stone fruit, mineral and yeasty aromas leads to a firm palate that's dry and tight. In terms of flavors, this brut nature is a touch salty, with apricot and orange notes. On the finish, yeasty, bready complexity is positive."
"From one of the state's most esteemed vineyards, this shows prominent toast, vanilla, coffee and marionberry aromas. The palate is considerably more restrained, bringing a sense of lightness. Alone, each delivers, but the two seem out of sync."
"This warm, ripe Chablis has a hint of tangy texture along with intense white-fruit acidity. It is a delicious wine, still young, and will be better from 2018."
"This delightfully fruity wine also has a great tang of acidity and minerality. It shows a crisp character, with a bite of apple peel and a lively mousse at the end. Drink now."

"This wine starts out as dense and fruity, but turns floral with airing. In the mouth, it's a bit jammy and overextracted, making for a weighty drinking experience. Flavors of prune, blackberry and dark chocolate end quickly on a finish that lacks the structure to go the distance."
"This wine's underbrush, menthol, dried herb and game aromas follow through to the firm, linear palate, along with sour cherry, pomegranate, espresso and clove flavors. Tightly woven tannins provide grip while a star anise note marks the close."
"Aromas like apple skin and peach skin lead to flavors with a little more heft and ripeness, like pears, lychees and apricots. It offers a lot of taste complexity and easily keeps the interest going with good acidity, medium body and an almost spicy finish."
"This is a light-hearted wine, delicious with acidity and with a light perfume. It has good concentration, with tight lemon and lime flavors. The wine is made by consultant Benjamin Mei. It is ready to drink."
"This leads with black-skinned berry, violet and eucalyptus aromas. The solid palate doles out blackberry jam, clove and black pepper notes alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020."
"Raspberry, plum and rose-petal aromas are dusty, floral and elegant. In the mouth, this wine is fit and spry, with crisp, pulling acidity. Herbal red plum and raspberry flavors finish with spice, mint and unabsorbed oak notes."
"As with many Provence ros producers, this wine comes from grapes harvested at night to preserve the freshness of the fruit. It has produced an attractive crisp wine with a pale-ros color and lively red-currant fruits. Drink now."

"Smoke, mineral, dark berry and vanilla aromas are followed by lighter black fruit flavors in this wine. It tapers off on the finish."
"This wine's aromas are quite generous, suggesting herbs, vanilla, baking spice and purple fruit. Its cranberry and cherry flavors are both tart and ripe, supported by soft tannins and a lingering caf au lait note. The oak influence gets in the way of the fruit at times, but it's pleasant all the same."
"This wine, which includes 17% Mourvdre and 8% Grenache, is a blend of fruit from Arianses, Stone Tree, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Baking spice, vanilla, dark fruit and cocoa aromas lead to ripe, generous black fruit flavors. It's a bold, hedonistic interpretation of the variety, with oak playing a prominent role."
"Walla Walla Valley Barbera is rare, although this producer consistently makes one. Its toasty spice, tart cherry and herb aromas give way to well-balanced plum and cherry flavors, needing food to truly shine."
"This ripe, warm wine is balanced between rich fruits and acidity. A lightly toasty edge accompanies ripe apricot and pear flavors. The acidity is just in balance, giving an attractive edge. Drink from 2018."
"This single-vineyard village wine comes from a small parcel close to woods on the western edge of the Mercurey appellation. With soft red fruits and attractive acidity, the wine is fruity, easy and with a crisp aftertaste. It will be ready to drink from 2018."
"The Ollires vineyard is set at the heart of a 1,500-acre estate close to the Sainte Victoire mountain. This white wine is fruity, fragrant and with plenty of tangy acidity. It is lifted by the citrus and filled out with the green plums. Drink from late 2017."
"Smooth textured, this wine is packed with ripe fruits that are touched with spice. Rounded and laden with apricot and mango flavors, it's ready to drink."
"Medium-intense notes of golden apple skin, lime peel and wild yellow flowers are graced by a hint of gingery spice. The medium-weight palate is slightly round and creamy, but not overly so, with a generous wood-grilled-apple flavor that lingers on the toasty finish."
"Pinched, briny red-fruit aromas are rubbery. This has a distinctly raw but juicy and fresh palate. Tea, plum, currant and pink-peppercorn flavors are gamy, savory and a bit salty on the finish. In every way, this reflects its cool coastal origins."
"Aged 40 months in French and Russian oak, this leads with green herb, bell pepper, vanilla, cherry and spice aromas and follows through with ripe black cherry flavors. The nose and palate seem disconnected, the green notes unusual for the appellation and vintage."
"This delicately spritzy bottling of Diamond, a Concord grape hybrid, offers all the juicy, grapy deliciousness of Concord with twists of tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Moderately sweet and light in alcohol, it's straightforward, fun and guzzle worthy."
"This is a plush and pleasantly concerntrated wine, with rich notes of black plum, cherry, and boysenberry that are spiced by notes of licorice and minty pepper. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts velvety tannins and a well-build, solid structure. A hint of char unfolds on the lingering finish."

"Aroams of high-toned cherry and berry lead the nose of this wine, with secondary scents of tar, balsamic and leathery spice. Medium weight and smooth in body, the satiny tannins provide a subtle, accessible structure, framed by juicy black-cherry and -raspberry flavors. Drink now."

"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oakhalf new American and half seasoned Frenchrides right over them."
"This wine's unusual purple fruit, citrus, herb and wood spice aromas waft up from the glass. The palate brings abundant orange peel flavors supported by tannins that are surprisingly firm for the variety. Citrus twist notes linger on the finish."
"Faint white flower, orange peel, spice and citrus aromas are followed by broad fruit flavors in this wine, which lacks concentration."

"A nose with diverse aromas of herbal berry, grilled meat, carob and compost doesn't exhibit clean fruit scents. A grabby palate with rugged tannins hosts hard-edged flavors of plum and leafy berry that dry out on a slightly murky, funky-tasting finish."
"Aromas suggesting dark berry, exotic spice and toasted oak come together in this. The tight palate is more subdued than the nose, recalling sour berry and powdered herbs alongside astringent tannins."
"A blend of 50% Grenache Blanc, 25% Macabeau, 15% Marsanne and 10% Roussanne, this opens with intense floral aromas of jasmine, apple blossom and peony. It's grounded by a core of ripe, opulent apple and melon fruit, with nutty accents that linger on the waxy finish."

"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec offers vanilla, herb and cherry aromas that seem a bit coarse. The palate is full of baking spice flavorsnotably vanilla. It's heavy on the oak notes, despite having aged in just 42% new French barrels, the rest older French and American."
"This wine's aromas are so light you have to strain to pick them out, yet it shows whiffs of volatility. The palate delivers sweet, smooth dark fruit flavors with a fair amount of heat. There's enough here to keep it interesting, needing more aromatic expression and balance to truly come together."

"Fresh white-fruit aromas are pure in their set up of a citric, racy palate. Salty orange leads to a briny finish with salty apple and citrus flavors."
"The appellation, at the southern end of the Mcon vineyards next to Pouilly Fuiss, is on limestone soil that gives great minerality to the texture. This wine, from old vines, is textured, tight and nervy, needing time to boost its white fruits. Drink from 2018."
"Apricot, lime cream and roasted nuts show on the nose of this blend of 36% Grenache Blanc, 28% Viognier, 18% Picpoul Blanc and 18% Roussanne. The palate is lacking a bit of texture and acidity, instead clinging to flavors of sour apple, gunmetal and flint."

"This combination of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon is so heavily oaked that it smells almost entirely of clove.

"There's a great historic ghost story behind this bottling, as well as a creative twist to the cork closure, but the wine itself isn't as exciting.

"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California. It's very tasty because of traits that are usually considered flaws. A tawny color and an aroma like tawny Port lead to a very soft texture, and warm plum, raisin and nut flavors. The wine is rather full in body, light on tannins, and tastes quite mature and mellow."

The blend is Carmenre, Syrah and Petit Verdot."

"Reserved aromas of plum, raisin and oak lead to a pinched palate that pulls to the center like a magnet. Peppery blackberry and cassis flavors are raw and without volume prior to a collapsed finish."
The deep-copper color and complex fruit aromas of this wine seem well matched with a rather broad texture and medium-full body. The raspberry flavors have a meaty savory accent.

"Black-skinned fruit, underbrush and game aromas lead the nose of this wine. The round, simple palate evokes mature black cherry and clove. Drink soon."
"Enchanting apricot and spice aromas are followed by full-bodied, creamy fruit flavors that provide intrigue but lack depth. Overall, it's a bit ponderous and short on the finish."
"This wine is sweet and syrupy, smelling like honeydew melon and bananas, and tasting a bit like peach nectar. It could be good after dinner with cheeses or a not-so-sweet dessert."

"Incorporating 30% of the variety in Musqu clone, this wine offers fresh flavors of green apple, grass and pea shoots, as well as a distinct notion of oak. Aged in both new and neutral Acacia, as well as stainless, it has a spicy quality akin to lemongrass that lingers on the finish."
"Rusty pink in color, this bottling shows somewhat sour aromas of red plum, turned earth, orange rind and tart raspberry. The palate offers dried cherry and more soil, but is missing the texture and acidity of many modern ross."

"Tropical fruit and hay aromas open this plump but basic SB that's low on acidity. Low-energy green-melon flavors are a bit briny, while a lack of punchy acidity leaves a short finish."
"This wine is crisp and refreshingly fruity. A lively texture gives brightness, and a light touch of acidity finishes the wine on a citrus note. Drink now."
"Spiced-apple aromas lead to a soft, perfumed wine that has a crisp, fruity edge. The apple and green-plum flavors give attractive acidity. Drink now."

"This almost-colorless Grenache Blanc smells of generic white fruits. The palate is lean, shearing and shares much in common with lime juice. Flavors of lime, tart apple and scallion are tangy on a clattering finish."
"This has subdued prune and tilled soil aromas. The simple, informal palate offers Morello cherry and black pepper flavors alongside loose-knit tannins. Drink soon."

"This wine is comprised of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Pinot Noir, 7% Malbec, 2% Petit Verdot and the remainder Syrah and Zinfandel. Neutral oak and stainless steel both played a part in housing its mix of juicy charcuterie and nutty robust amounts of cassis and baked strawberry."

"A yeasty nose smells all right but somewhat artificial and not that fruity. A low-acid palate has flavors of melon and grape skins, but the total package seems a touch nutty and prematurely stale. A flat finish is consistent with what came before."
"Gritty white-fruit and green aromas are more neutral than loud. This has a sharp, citric mouthfeel that's all about acidity. Tart flavors of citrus and mixed greens finish salty."
"This typical, fruity wine from Gascony offers lemon and herbal flavors and a crisply tangy texture. It's a light, breezy wine, full of fruit and tight with acidity. Drink this refreshing wine now."

That cedar is powerful on the sip too, with a touch of black-cherry fruit managing to pop out along with dried herbs."
"Notes of earth and dust amplify savory tones of pressed apple and cider. Brisk lemon-lime acidity on the palate lends some brightness. The finish is moderately long, accented by a kiss of honeycomb. Drink now."

"With its small proportion of Aligot in the blend, this crisp, fruity wine is lively with acidity. Citrus flavors are given an extra fillip by a zingy aftertaste. Drink now."
"Earthy aromas of roasted red plum blend with scents of latex and cured meat on a jumbled nose. Like any Rufete, this feels drawing and rubbery, with choppy tannins. Flavors of tomato, currant and red plum are tart and narrow on a drawing finish."
"This is a sweet wine, floral in aroma, rich in texture and sugary in flavor that tastes like watermelon and pink lemonade. It's light in alcohol, fruity and straightforward."
"This ripe and creamy wine offers yellow fruits and a soft texture. The acidity is just right for all the rich fruit, giving a lift of citrus to the smooth texture. It is ready to drink."
This medium-bodied wine is well rounded in texture. The touch of sweet pear in the flavors gives counterpoint to herb and fennel aromas and some citrusy acidity.
"This bottling is very herbal on the nose, with bay leaf, pine needle, juniper, tart strawberry and black-pepper aromas. The palate shows sour red fruit, dried leather and much more forest-floor flavors."
"This is a Mcon region-wide blend, simple and fruity with an attractively crisp texture. It has a citrus character, slightly salty as well as tangy with orange zest. Drink now."
"Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018."
"Light and crisp, this wine has citrus and green-plum flavors. It is still developing, with plenty of acidity as well a perfumed character. Drink this attractive wine from 2018."
"Chemical resiny aromas stand out more than fruit. This Viura-led blend feels tight, tangy and acidic. Salty flavors of persimmon lack fruitiness. This 12% ABV wine from a cold vintage tastes salty on a finish that's living off acidity."
"Leafy red-berry aromas come with a note of olive. This wine feels lean and searing, with edgy tannins and high acidity. Spicy flavors of herbal plum and tomato finish with a dusting of baking spices."

"Fermented in large French-oak barrels, Sannino's regular-label Chardonnay has a slightly rounded, open-knit feel. It's not a deeply complex wine but offers straightforward red apple flavors backed by a hint of spice. Drink now."
A touch of spritz lends verve to pressed apple and spice notes in this light-footed Chardonnay. It's slim and a bit simple on the palate but finishes refreshingly crisp. Drink now.
"Pyrazine-based notes of green pepper are most prominent on a basic nose. This feels lean and stony. Briny, salty citrus flavors lack complexity."
"Foxy, spicy berry aromas settle on briny plum and currant. This is dry, grabby and mildly abrasive in feel. Herbal plum flavors seem a bit roasted. It's scratchy and tannic on the finish, with controlled bitterness."
"This 100% varietal wine shows medicine cabinet, barnyard, Band-Aid and dried fruit aromas followed by dried out fruit and medicinal flavors. The tannins bring some dryness."

"This is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a bitter edge. Jammy cherry fruits lie behind this structure, along with acidity. The wine will soften and be ready to drink from 2018."
A light-gold color and mild white-fruit aromas set up a palate with lightly oxidized apple flavors. This Viura seems to be losing steam given that the finish is more bready and cidery in flavor than fresh.
"This pitch-black Malbec smells like prune juice. That overripe character also shows on the overweight palate that deals saturated flavors of fig, raisin and prune. The finish doesn't display a lot of balance or freshness. Two samples tasted with identical results."
"A darker shade of blood orange in the glass, this bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon shows cranberry and orange on the nose. It's quite flat on the sip, with sour orange, strawberry and plum notes, and that makes it seem more like an afterthought than a focused ros, which is such a competitive category now."
"Light peach and ale notes mark the nose of this wine. The palate is dry, and the flavors somewhat flat, making it hard to ascertain the variety."
This wine is very soft and only lightly fruity. Some spice and touches of acidity give a crisp edge to the otherwise dull wine.
"This rustic, herbal Tinto Fino has tarry blackberry and cassis aromas that turn horsey, minty and herbal on a nose that struggles to hold up. After hinting at savory berries, flavors turn green, bitter and underripe. It finishes with rough tannins and heat."
"This light and fruity wine, produced by a Burgundy negotiant, is full of bitter cherry crispness. It is ready to drink, offering acidity and a tight, bright aftertaste."
"This rounded, creamy wine is attractive, with rich apricots and balanced zesty acidity. It is ready to drink."
"Mealy apple and orange custard aromas set the stage for this ripe, fleshy white. There's a roundness to the mouthfeel, as those notes continue through to the palate, though the finish offers a pithy citrus astringency that helps to enliven the experience."
"You almost need to lean into the glass to perceive this wine's faint citrus, candlewax and herb aromas, which show some reduction. It's equally subtle on the palate and lacks concentration."
"There is a bounty of herbally inflected red fruit on the nose of this bottling, with hints of tea, mushroom and pepper, which make for an intriguing but somewhat odd expression. The herbal flavors on the palate are reminiscent of chewing on bay leaves."

"This soft, light wine has hints of citrus and acidity. It is fruity, crisp and bright with orange zest at the end. Drink now."
"Foxy berry and currant flavors carry a note of wet dog fur. This is clampy and saucy feeling on the palate, with herbal flavors of plum, berry and tomato sauce. A hollow finish tastes slightly green."
"Harsh, rubbery black-fruit aromas include notes of mushroom and horseradish. A shallow palate with hard tannins doesn't offer much space for a soft landing. It tastes largely of hickory on a choppy finish."
"This cherry-fruited wine is spicy, but a strong acid streak gives a raw aftertaste that should have softened by now. It is ready to drink."
"Classic, simple and fruity, this is an immediately accessible wine. With bright red fruits and a soft, juicy texture, it is crisp, lively and ready to drink."
"This pale ros has subdued strawberry aromas and a hint of residual sugar. It comes off as quite generic, without a lot of flavor to bring it to life."
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault is light and fruity, with a touch of red-fruit candy. It has a soft aftertaste that suggests the wine is not bone dry. Drink now."
"Sweet caramelized flavors of crme brle dominate in this wine that is showy in oak with sharp layers of green apple, melon and lime."
"Clean notes of apple, melon and lime peel unfold of the nose and carry through to the lightweight mouth. There's ample acidity to keep the palate fresh, with a short finish."
"This wine has easy flavors that are bursting with red cherry. A shot of tannin gives this open, fruity wine shape. It is ready to drink."
"This soft, gentle wine has some attractive citrus and apple fruits. Easy to drink, it offers a crisp tangy aftertaste. It is not a wine for aging, so drink now."
"This wine is fairly soft and muted, with delicate aromas of straw, apple and underripe white melon. The palate is similarly light in feel and intensity, with low acidity and a short finish."
"A meaty, gamy character graces the red-fruit core of this lightweight wine. The tannins are soft, with light acidity and a subtle cherry-cola flavor that unfolds on the close. Drink now."
"Vegetal aromas of canned peas are also oddly powdery. This feels racy and healthy, but flavors of canned veggies echo the nose. A salty, green-tasting, peppery finish yields little to no fruit."
"This bottling offers a tarry backbone on the nose with a hint of crushed elderberry. The palate is a bit bitter, with Concord grape flavors cut by tar and bittersweet dark chocolate shavings."
"Very treacly aromas of overripe strawberry, brown sugar and maple syrup show on this dessert-like wine. It's very sweet on the palate, with sweet tea, prune and raisin flavors."
"Dusty white-fruit aromas are grassy and smell of vitamins. This is plump on the palate, with little cut or edge. Generic apple and melon flavors are cloying on the finish."
This is spicy with a strong floral character. Its red-berry fruits are shot through with acidity. The crispness and attractiveness of the wine are spoiled just by the hint of candy and caramel. Drink now.
"This soft wine is open, rounded with a balance between fruit and crisp acidity. Simple and gentle, it's ready to drink."
"Delicate aromas of red apple and dried grass tease on the nose of this soft wine, while slightly more assertive flavors of lime and white melon rind unfold on the medium-weight mouth. Ample acidity keeps the finish fresh, but short."
"This wine is soft and very rich. That takes away from the fruit and leaves a broad wine, smooth and with a touch of pepper from alcohol. It is too big."

"Dark aromas of tire rubber, forest and juniper are lead elements on the nose. This Syrah is astringent, with rawness to the palate. There's a sense of grape skins to the black-fruit flavor profile, and the tone just seems a little off."
"Unfocused, somewhat compromised aromas of green banana and papaya are a bit soapy. This is acceptable but coarse in feel. Peppery green-fruit flavors echo in milder fashion on the finish."
"Accents of cola spice and cardamom lend a spicy overlay to the black plum and berry core of this wine. It's surprisingly light in weight, with soft tannins and plush, sweet oak-spice tones that dominate the finish."

"This is a soft, rounded wine, with ripe fruit that seems unfocused. The fruit and the acidity are reticent, not giving the wine much shape. A simple, ripe wine, it can be drunk now."
The tarry herbal aromas and roasted peppery flavors of this medium-bodied wine give it a rather lean taste profile and the texture is moderately tannic.
"While this wine is full, it has an indistinct character. A soft texture and only light fruitiness leave a dull impression."
"Aromas of spicy but sticky ripe black fruits feed into a creamy, almost gooey palate. Notes of clove, cinnamon and brown sugar are amplified alongside candied, jammy berry flavors."

"A soft, dilute wine, this is gently fruity. Acidity gives a lift at the end. Drink now."

"This broad wine is soft, indistinct and suffers from overripe fruit. It needs a shot of acidity to give it life and interest."
"Herbal, spicy aromas are strange, like uncooked hot dogs. This is plump on the palate, with flavors of spiced tomato and little more. A grabby finish lacks refinement."
"Light, dry and rather neutral in character, this wine is low in acidity and fruitiness, offering a bit of watermelon flavor."
"Applesauce aromas come with a note of sugar-coated beignet. This feels a little sticky, while scattershot flavors of grapefruit juice, lychee, mango and lime finish sweet but also green."

"A fruitless nose smells of mealy grape skins, spoiled apple and peach pit. Unfocused white-fruit flavors are mealy and funky on the finish."

"Stale, stewy aromas lack vitality and suggest compost. This wine is edgy as well as creamy in feel, while flavors of cottage cheese and broken-down berry fruits finish with rooty, tomatoey notes. This is now eight years old and fading."
Lemon-jelly aromas give this a strange character. The fruit reflects the same artificial flavor. It is hard to see where it is going.
"Briny aromas include too much mussel shell, sea water and compost. This wine is spritzy and coarse-feeling, with briny, pickled flavors of sauerkraut, scallion and sea shell. A briny finish leaves offputting lasting flavors."
"Odd and unusual aromas of murky fruit and clove are matched on the palate, which tastes of fake oak, clove and little else. This Pinot seems more artificial than natural."
"This clipped, sharp wine leads with berry and plum scents. In the mouth, it's all acid and no fruit, tasting extremely sour."
"Stale cider, squash and pumpkin-pie aromas are not inviting. This feels austere and tastes underripe, with vegetal flavors of mushroom, celery and cabbage. There's no finish."
"Jammy berry aromas come in front of green, vegetal notes. The palate is round and lacks balancing acidity."
"With layers upon layers of spicy saffron, peach, honey and caramel to be enjoyed on the nose alone, this heady botrytized Riesling is pure hedonism.

It's already a heart-stopping wine but will continue to improve for decades to come."
"Polished and well structured, this vibrant, savory red hits all the high notes. It opens with enticing red cherry, pressed rose, ground clove and balsamic scents that follow through to the chiseled palate, along with crushed cranberry and licorice notes. Firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity lend impeccable balance and finesse. Drink 20232043."
"This is a superb blend of aged tawny Ports, blended to celebrate the company's 325th anniversary.

Like any tawny Port, it is ready to drink."
"Exhilarating tropical perfume leaps from the glass of this intensely aromatic Trockenbeerenauslese. Sweet peach and tangerine flavors are exceptionally concentrated, swathed by caramel and saffron.

"Named after neighboring winery owner Mike Etzel (Beaux Frres), this exceptional wine is brilliantly focused and rippling with muscular depth. The palate is etched with blackberry and black cherry fruit, immersed in lush vanilla, coffee and caramel tones. It's instantly gratifying, impossibly seductive and exceptional in every way."
"This is a new project from Christophe Baron. The aromas pop, with notes of earth, plum, nori, iron, sea salt, herb, olive tapenade, black pepper and smoked meat. The palate is concentrated and structured, with rich yet restrained bacon fat and smoke flavors that bring a sense of vibrancy and richness along with a near endless finish. It brings a fair amount of tannic heft that will benefit from some additional time in the bottle. Best from 2024-2028."
"From Draper clone vines planted in 1965, this bright gold-hued wine brings myriad details to its apple, jicama, white peach and nut oil flavors. A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030."
"New leather, red berry, tobacco and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find in this powerfully structured but elegant wine. The firm palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and cinnamon flavors framed by noble, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 20252045."
"The aromas explode with notes of potpourri, olive, smoked meat, fire pit, orange peel, mineral, mushroom, garrigue and white pepper.

It's shockingly good."
"This wine comes from a vineyard, created in 1894, in which the vines are planted against walls to get the maximum reflected heat. It is a majestic winea smooth wave, opulent and rich with intense acidity and just a hint of spice. The wine is just ready to drink, although it will be even more impressive from 2018."
"Beautifully perfumed, this is a ripe and structured wine. It has fine dusty tannins, intense blackberry fruits and a dark-licorice aftertaste. Acidity keeps the wine fruity and fresh although with those firm tannins, it will need time. Drink from 2027."
"For fans of the variety, this is a consistently blockbuster wine, well made and remarkably fruity and floral. Violet aromas ride quietly over rounded flavors of cherry pie as the body takes on full-figured dimension. Richly voluptuous, there's balance here within the firm robust tannin structure and heady licorice-laden end."
"Powerful, dusty tannins dominate this ripe wine. With its great blackberry fruits, currants and juicy acidity, it is already balanced. The power comes from the dry tannins and the rich, concentrated fruits. Drink from 2026."

"Feather light in texture yet deeply penetrating in flavor, this sprightly sip offers rolling waves of sweet caramel, honey and stone-fruit flavors. It's luscious and mouth-filling in texture but balanced by strikes of lime acidity and a dry pristine finish. Irresistible already at over a decade of age, but it is also composed enough to improve decades longer."
"Rich, dense and intense, this is a big, muscular rendering of Barossa Shiraz. Scents of maple syrup and menthol intertwine with flavors of ripe plums and grilled meat. It's mouthcoating and long on the tannic finish, so give it some time in the cellar; drink 20202030."
This wine is ripe with tannins and powerful with ripe fruit. A solid character gives it density. The tannins and the richness of the wine are ripe and concentrated with fruit. Drink from 2026.

Fresh acidity balances it all out. Drink 20232043."

"One of the hallmarks of delicious six puttonyos Tokaj is a delicate balance of acidity and sweetness on the palate. This wine hits that mark with accuracy and has tantalizing apricot, Bananas Foster, beeswax and caramelized pineapple aromas, which follow through seamlessly to the palate. As it opens, more pronounced lemon meringue and acacia honey flavors emerge. The texture is luxurious and silky."
"Terroir is the key in this wine from a single parcel in the Douro. A field blend, it has more than 20 varieties in the mix. It is very Douro: structured, mineral and with initially austere fruit that broadens out. It is ready to drink from 2019."
"Made by Elias Fernandez in partnership with Doug Shafer, this red totally rocks in smoky toasted oak and a tease of char.

"This is a classic of Sancerreenormously rich, packed with fruit and a touch of vanilla. It is the fruit, though, that sings in this beautiful wine. Mango and peach blend with the crispest citrus flavors. The wine demands aging and is still young. Drink from late 2018."
"Gorgeous aromatics of heady voluptuousness conjure elements of caramel, honey and baked apple behind a golden hue of color in this memorable, no-holds-barred white. The flavors follow through along a lengthy layered pathway lined in sparks of anise and key lime, finishing in juicy crisp acidity."
"This reserve-level selection was aged in 100% new French oak and sports a green label that distinguishes it from the dozen or so other Pinots in the winery's portfolio. It's dense and deeply flavored, its black fruit supported by an assortment of highlightscola, coffee and moist earth most prominent. There's a faint hint of barnyard funk, adding yet another element to a most impressive effort. Drink now and over the next half decade."

"This wine is dense, dark with tannins while also perfumed. A solid structure gives concentration and richness. It will be a hugely fruity wine with a dense aftertaste. Drink from 2027."
"Black cherry and cola flavors burst from the glass in this wine. Its fruit core has a candied, lollipop-like character, but that's not to suggest that it's anything but complex, deep and utterly delicious. The delicate finish extends the pleasure for minutes on end."
"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025."

Exciting to taste now, but best to drink after 2020."
"The wine's name means Sancerre from the old days, or made in a traditional way. Certainly if that way was to make a superb rich wine with great fruit, then this succeeds. It comes from flint soil and that's discernible in the steely edge that gives a contrast to the ripe fruit. Drink this still-young wine, with its wood-aging flavors from 2019."
"Wild berry, aromatic herb, crushed blue flower and exotic spice aromas lead the way in this full-bodied wine. It delivers ripe but elegant Marasca cherry, cranberry, licorice and vanilla hints framed by taut, fine-grained tannins that lend structure and finesse. Drink 20212033."
"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest."

"Leather, truffle, grilled herb, purple flower and perfumed berry aromas take shape in this fragrant red. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering red cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and clove flavors while nervous acidity and youthfully assertive, refined tannins provide support and balance. A star anise note wraps up the finish. Drink 20222034."
This is one of the several limited-production wines from this great producer. It shows great intensity and a tangy balance between the yellow and pineapple fruits and a tight mineral texture. It is certainly rich but so well balanced that its concentration is just right. Drink from 2019.
"Produced from biodynamically grown grapes, the wine was aged in wooden vats to promote the oxygenation and richness of the already ripe fruits. The result is a serious wine, one with intense fruit and with a broad swathe of ripe white stone fruits and mineral texture.

"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular."

Medium bodied and well-made, it finds balance between its coastal influence, its crisp acidity and the burlier aspects of fruit and weight."
"This complex and powerful wine is loaded with gravitasbig and tannic, yet also offering elegance and detail. The mix of fruit, spice, barrel and tannin components is beautifully orchestrated, recalling boysenberry, black cherry, toasted nuts, pepper and chocolate. With its almost-neverending finish, it should continue to improve through 2028."

"This is a wood-aged wine, named after the founder of the Mellot dynasty in the 16th century. It is richly endowed, packed with fine white fruit that contrasts with the stony steely texture.

But it's not unctuous, due to great underlying acidity that keeps it lively."
"Showing just a touch of reduction, this wine is bright, crunchy and explosive on the palate. The palate shows a mix of raspberry, cherry and cranberry that's full of flavor.

With all that depth and layering, it still comes across as balanced, even elegant. Best after 2030."

"Black-fruit aromas blend nicely into chocolate, vanilla and savory fig scents on the nose of this Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend. A dense, well-structured palate holds savory flavors of plum and baked berry fruits. A complex finish that revolves around mild oak and salty fruit flavors is lasting. Drink through 2023."
"Like the winery's other Pinot Noir, this seems way underpriced for the quality. Its subtle layers of cherry and plum are enhanced with baking spice, toasted coconut and caramel highlights. It can easily stand beside wines costing twice as much. Drink now through 2028."

"This Barbaresco's pressed violet, Asian spice, menthol and woodland berry aromas lift out of the glass. Fresh, structured and elegant, the palate evokes juicy Marasca cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a blast of orange zest while youthfully assertive tannins and racy acidity provide support. Drink after 2024."
"Winemaker James MacPhail continues to refine his solo project with this Annapolis-sourced effort, a smooth layered expression of baked strawberry and rose petal herbaceousness. Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time."
"A few swirls of the glass release this white's heady stone fruit, Spanish broom and Mediterranean brush aromas. Mirroring the nose, the vibrant palate delivers green apple, lemon, tangerine and white peach flavors framed by crisp acidity. It has nice length and a hint of ginger that caps the finish."
"This wine's forest floor, new leather, wild berry, clove and balsamic aromas lead the way, along with a heady whiff of violet.

"This single-vineyard blend includes Jaen's fruitiness and Touriga Nacional's strength. That makes for a smooth, juicy wine, richly endowed with the spice of wood aging but more generously with the red fruits of the Jaen grape. Dusty tannins show behind all this delicious fruit. Drink this concentrated wine now."
"Colheita must be barrel-aged for at least seven years, but Poas went for the long haul, bottling this in 2017. The result is a deep-gold color and richly mature flavors. Caramel, spice and a dry edge from the wood aging gives it character, just hinting at the brandy, with acidity at the end. It is rich and ready to drink."
"This 100% varietal wine is grown in Pope Valley on the eastern edge of the valley. Asian five-spice, strawberry and raspberry meld together seamlessly as a grip of tannin persists alongside a side note of oak. Ripe and rich, it has a pretty nose of bay and mocha, finishing smoothly etched in supportive, subtle acidity."
"This ripe, charred, dark-as-night Malbec captures the lush essence of Argentina at its finest. Deep aromas of licorice, blackberry, coffee and toast set up a full, layered palate, with vanilla, baking spice, black plum and blackberry flavors. A lusty finish with licorice, mocha and tobacco notes is generous and dandy. Drink through 2023."
"This late harvest sweet wine has caramelized pineapple, beeswax and apricot aromas that carry over effortlessly to the palate. It's soft and silky in texture, with a delicately sweet finish."

Light bodied and ultimately balanced, it brightens on the palate with a whirl of blood orange that complements the cranberry, pomegranate and cherry cola."
"This wine's red berry, fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and new saddle leather scents lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and anise notes set against tightly wound tannins and vibrant acidity. Youthfully austere, it needs time to fully come together. Drink 20222034."
"Named for the address of the vineyard on Live Oak Road, this blend of 30% Grenache, 24% Syrah, 20% Mourvdre, 13% Cinsault, 10% Counoise and 3% Viognier shows powerful licorice, cola, caramel, baked plum and thyme on the nose. The tannins are extremely soft on the sip, where lavish but not overripe purple flowers and black fruit compete for attention."

"The dense tannins of this wine balance the ripeness. With concentration and generous blackberry fruits, it is a rich wine, broadly structured and with swathes of opulent fruit. It will need plenty of time, so drink from 2026."
"This wine was aged in hogsheads (300 liter) and demi-muids (500 liter). The oak provides a subtle frame, adding hints of pencil shavings and scorched pie crust to the ripe berry flavors. The wine is still big, lush and unmistakably Barossa Valley, showing off raspberries and blueberries to an unusual (and welcome) extent. Supple enough to drink now, it should also age well through at least 2025."
"One barrel of each of Trisaetum's three estate vineyards contributed to this reserve bottling. It's the most closed of their dry Rieslings, requiring a hearty decant to show its stuffing: tart apple and citrus fruit, with streaks of vanilla and spice. Or age it a few years longer to allow more nuances to emerge."
"Warm spicy wintertime scents like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg meet baked fruit flavors and a broad soothing texture in this full-bodied wine. The color has an amber tint at the rim, the texture is absolutely mouth-filling but gentle, and the finish lingers nicely. The husband-wife winemaking duo let native yeast ferment the wine, and then aged it in 33% new French barrels from Remond."
"This distinctive wine has a light-garnet color and intriguing raspberry and cranberry aromas that lead to full red- and black-cherry flavors accented by rosemary and wood smoke. Fermented by native yeast and using some whole clusters for the astringency and flavor that stems can add, it has a texture that's moderately tannic and nicely supported by acidity."
"Vibrant aromas of raspberry, tart cherry, lavender, red flowers and freshly plucked garden herbs show on the pretty nose of this bottling by Zac Wasserman.

Altogether it is both light and lively."
"This richly structured wine comes from the the state-owned Companhia das Lezirias, the largest estate in Portugal. With equestrian events, wine, olive oil and an ecological sanctuary just east of Lisbon, the property merits a visit. Named for the barn owl that nests in estate forests, the wine is opulent, dense and packed with tannins and ripe black fruits. Give it time, at least until late 2018."
"This tight and energetic wine opens with menthol, new leather, wild berry, blue flower and grilled herb aromas. The focused palate mirrors the nose, offering juicy sour cherry, cranberry, star anise and clove flavors framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity."
"Brooding aromas of crushed rock, mineral, black olive, soot, cracked black pepper, charcuterie and dried herb lead to fresh, focused flavors that are flavorful but remain light on their feet. It shows a bit more tannic heft than this area often shows along with great length on the meaty finish."
"Alluring aromas of moist earth, cassis bud, olive, nori, pipe tobacco, charcoal, funk and mineral give way to lithe fruit and savory flavors with an ultra soft feel. The texture is absolutely dazzling."

"Hedonistic berry, raisin and fig flavors are complete. While this is tight and tough on the palate, it's solid as a boulder in terms of structure and balance. A ripe mix of black-fruit and mocha flavors finishes with all the power one could ask for. Drink this Bordeaux blend through 2027."

"Made in even smaller amounts than the vintage before it, this combines 90% Petite Sirah with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from old head-pruned vines.

Softly textured, the wine is incredibly fragrant and inviting in white pepper."

"From the biodynamically farmed Momtazi vineyard, this adds layers of herb, pine, compost and forest floor components.

This will age very well, but is tasty now."

"Styring releases their wines with plenty of bottle age and doesn't shy from high alcohol. The level of ripeness in this bottling is not for everyone, veering more toward Zin-like power than Pinot Noir elegance. It's lushly aromatic, with dominant pine needle and raspberry extract flavors. A dense, concentrated and pungent wine with a spicy top note."
"Firm and steely in structure yet decadently fruity, this light-footed Sptlese offers substance and pleasure in spades. Luscious yellow-peach and tangerine flavors are plush on the palate but balanced judiciously with racy acidity and a deep tang of minerality. Gorgeous already but could hold well through 2021."

"From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-Fum, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018."
"From vines planted in 1984 and 1990, this offers subtle, strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, accented with refreshing minerality. Its acidity a faint lime flavor, and as is true of all this winery's offerings, the overall balance is impeccable."

"Always a strength in the winery's white wine lineup, this is sourced from both Columbia Valley and Rogue Valley vineyards.

It's all in perfect proportion, and absolutely delicious lightly chilled."
"This opens with textbook Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, forest floor, red berry, culinary spice and a whiff of blue flower. On the savory palate, taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity support Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and white pepper flavors that should integrate after a few more years in bottle. Drink after 2022."
"Beautiful black-cherry fruit meets with touches of caramel and liquefied violet on the well-integrated nose of this bottling from the oldest Syrah planting in Santa Barbara County. The flavors are still a bit wound up, even four years on, but the black-currant, lavender, rosemary and charred-beef elements should rise above the wine's firm sticky tannins soon. Drink 20182023."

"The residual sugar in this bottling is half what it was in the last vintage, striking an ideal balance between sweetness and alcohol. Its lime, tangerine and cantaloupe flavors show some sappy staying power. Drink now or age another decade."
"This is a balanced blend of seven grapes, headed by Bairrada's own Baga. It is this grape that gives the tannins and tight acidity that dominate this structured wine. Its potential is considerable, with its texture still evolving. The black-currant fruits at the end are crisp and will soften with age. Drink from 2019."
"This is a boldly jammy uninhibitedly ripe winea mix of compost, old barn, jammy raspberry and prune. The size and structure work well together, with toasted oak supporting brawny texture and grip."
"Maison Louis Jadot's Willamette Valley project continues to bear fruit and has increased the production of this entry-level cuve.

Enjoy through 2022."
"Very light in the glass, this bottling from a very cool-climate vineyard shows a clean line of honeysuckle, crisp Asian pear and tart lime blossoms on the nose. There is great tension to the tight and tart lime-laced sip, with some nectarine ripeness in the midpalate, lots of chalky texture and a sizzle of acidity. Racy as can be, it's great now, but will last for years. Drink now through 2030."
"By Mendoza standards, this is a more delicate Malbec, with aromas of spices, cocoa and oak as opposed to heavily extracted fruit and toast. Mild acidic chop lends tension to flavors of tomato, herbs, licorice and dried plum. A bright and healthy finish preserves quality until the end. Drink through 2021."

It's dry, with delicate tannins and a clean finish that lingers and evolves."

"Plum and blackberry aromas dominate a fruit-forward nose with palpable oak and toast. This is rock-solid and firm on the palate. Ripe flavors of baked black fruits are darkened by toast and chocolate notes. On the finish, this tastes of fig and peppery spice. Drink through 2023."
"Aged in wood for up to 14 months, this wine is rich and smooth. Produced from low-yielding old vines, it's a field blend of many different varieties. It is ripe with layers of black currant and spice flavors along with acidity. The wine has weight but remains stylish. Drink from 2018."

Beet root, pomegranate and chocolate suggestions come together on the midpalate, seemingly gaining concentration as it finishes. Fresh, clean and well balanced, it spent just the right amount of time in one-third-new French oak."
"The delicate yet brilliant pink color of this ros is stunning (Could it be protected by the darker glass, a rare packaging choice for the style?) and the wine inside matches up, starting with a brisk nose of red apple, white cherry, strawberry and lime. There's red plum and more strawberry to the sip. With a grippy texture and steadily rising acidity, this is one of the better pinks of the vintage."

The palate is also very energetic with black-plum and orange-juice flavors, finishing with strong acidity. This will last for years, but needs at least another year to fully integrate."
"This bottling's extremely fresh aromas of lime meet with a rounded clarified butter, drawing one in for sip after sip. That vibrancy extends to the lightly presented palate, where flavors of lime juice, lemon peels and crisp pear ride a rising wave of acidity across a tightly wound texture."
"Roasted meats, black fruit, charcoal and tar show on the nose of this clonal selection from this pioneering winery that is now owned by Bill Foley.

The acid and tannin levels are solid right now and will age well too."

"This is the last vintage from this site from this producer: a sad farewell that doesn't hold back on ripeness or full-figured body. Lush and soft on the palate, it has a strong sense of self, etched in black cherry, chocolate mint and firm tannin. Sock it away and best enjoy beginning in 2024."
"This powerful wine has big ideas, as indicated by the weight of the bottle. The wine itself is dense, showing some signs of extraction that give a dry and firm aspect to the wine. A juicy, black-plum aftertaste adds lift."

It starts with smoky black pepper aromas, then offers concentrated blackberry, dark chocolate and charred meat flavors, along with a rich wrapping of fine-grained tannins. Best after 2020."

"The slightest bit funky on the nose, this bottling shows dried-cherry, rusty-cranberry, gravel and dried-herb aromas. The barnyard character also shows a tad on the sip, where leathery flavors of tart cherries, dried pomegranate and thyme are reminiscent of properly aged red Burgundies."
"Brawny as a leather pouch, this big-shouldered wine shows the age of its vines in blackberry-compote flavor and accents of cinnamon and smoky char. Bright perfumed aromatics lift the burly, concentrated fruit alongside supportive acidity and a succulent finish."

"David and Anna deLaski planted this obscure grape on their home vineyard to honor her Austrian rootsthe results are fascinating. A dark earthy graphite-driven minerality contrasts with the brighter sweeter strawberry and cherry fruit on the nose, and then the bone-dry sip pops with a candied raspberry flavor, enhanced by fennel and white pepper."

"This juicy, ripe and rich wine has a sweet jammy background, giving concentration as well as good acidity and an open, ripe texture. Drink this already accessible wine from 2025."

"This estate vineyard in the heart of the appellation provides this wine with a generosity of spirit and flavor, all within a light-bodied package of elegance and restraint.

Give it time to unwind and integrate. Drink 20182043."

"This bottling is still very young and will vastly improve with time, but already shows many of the components that make this remote mountain-surrounded vineyard one of the more exciting slices of the region. Aromas of black currant and purple flowers are deep and heady, while the palate's richer blackberry-syrup notes are cut by a black-plum tang, fresh underbrush herbaceousness and tons of cola spice."

"There's a lot of desert-based flavors to explore and enjoy in this blend, starting with a prominent chaparral underbrush and campfire tone to the nose, followed by the tangy red-plum, smoke, salt and pepper notes.

"It's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shirazmedium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit. Drink now2025."
"Austere on the nose, and light on the palate, this vineyard-designated expression of this Rhne variety works in its full embrace of succulent pear, peach and tart citrus. Given time in neutral oak, it has enough body to remain meaningful in the glass around dry, focused acidity."
"A brick red in color, this bottling of an usually blended variety is quite compelling and delicious, starting with the intriguing nose of pine needle and smashed red plum. The palate picks up Mourvdre's leathery hallmark, which gives rustic elegance to the red cherry and pine needle spice."

"Light and creamy in lemon meringue with a shake of salt, this 100% varietal white has full-flavored intensity and a floral aromatic streak that invites. Dry, it spent time aging in both new French oak and stainless steel, riding both waves with graceful ease."
"This is technically a white wine but with eyes closed it could be taken for a big red. The color is orange, the aromas are earthy and extremely citric, while the flavors are laser focused on orange and lemon zest. Acidity and tannins coat the palate and give it a mouth-puckering grip. It's not for the meek, but the adventurous will love it."

"Prunelard (or Prunelart) is a Gaillac grape that had almost disappeared. Revived by a few enterprising producers, it produces a distinctly fruity, aromatic wine. This bottling's firm edge of tannins and juicy acidity contribute structure and intense fruitiness. Still bursting with youth, it should be aged for another year. Drink from 2018."
"This wine comes from a single vineyard on the south bank of the Vienne river. It is ripe, perfumed and generously rich with concentrated blackberry fruit and balanced tannins. Some wood aging has broadened the wine rather than adding flavor. The wine could age another year with noticeable benefit, so drink from 2018."
"Dense and rich on the palate, this shows the concentration achieved in this coastal location. Snap pea, pineapple and nectarine elements combine for a harmonious whole that lingers on the finish, picking up more austere hints of wet stone. Drink now."
"Extracted, grapy aromas suggest raisin and prune but this wine is not overtly overripe. In the mouth, it is grabby and a bit raisiny. Rich, heady flavors of mocha, fig and prune finish with chunky weight. Drink through 2020."
"Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 59% of this wine, with 35% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot blended in for good measure. Together, they offer firm lengthy tannins and a generous presence of body and weight. The darker characteristics of chocolate and blackberry are balanced by crisp red currant and spicy clove."
"Produced from organic grapes, the wine is beautiful and honey touched. Its acidity keeps crispness while the fruit shines with lemon and creamed-apple flavors. Drink from 2018."
"Displaying typical McMinnville AVA subtlety, this frames its tight raspberry fruit with mineral and iron ore details. Aging in neutral oak has helped soften the sharp edges a bit, without flavoring the wine."
"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s."
"The wine is ripe, dense and with fine layers of green fruits, grapefruit and acidity. The flinty texture is still strong in this young wine which bursts with youthful fruitiness. It is going to develop well into an impressive wine. Drink from late 2018."
"Produced entirely from vines planted in 1978, this drinks drier than its 13 g/L of residual sugar would indicate. It's juicy and loaded with apple, pear and tangerine fruit. A tangy taste of orange baby aspirin lingers on the finish."
"Juicy and fresh red fruit meets an herbal woody component in this winea nod to its inclusion of 12% Cabernet Franc. Firm integrated tannins support the full-bodied frame of approachable richness and plush texture, working toward a seamless whole."
"This rich and creamy wine definitely pulls out the new barrel flavors, with buttery nut, salted caramel and toast notes highlighting its ripe peach and apple fruit. From vines planted in 1989, it's styled for drinking right now."
"Tightly wound aromas of blueberry and black currant ride a cedar backbone on the elegant nose of this blend of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, which also offers a touch of vanilla. The palate balances dill and marjoram with tangy red fruit and cinnamon spice."
"Raisiny berry, spice cake and molasses aromas are rich and heady. This nonvintage blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a bit thick and oaky on the palate. Flavors of blackberry and creamy oak finish ripe and rooty, with a reprise of raisin."
"There's a boisterous amount of freshly pressed boysenberry juice, crushed graphite and sweet rose on the very accessible, somewhat soda-poppy nose of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Petit Verdot, 20% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The medium-bodied palate is plummy with a hint of fennel."
"Plump blackberry, dark strawberry, dried herbs and baking spice show on the nose of this well-rounded and easily likable bottling. The palate mixes fleshy red and purple fruit with a strong chaparral component in the midpalate. The firm grippy texture makes this a more serious Zinfandel than most."
"Dark-golden colored, this block designate opens in a wealth of butter and wild vanilla, before unveiling interwoven layers of juicy acidity and integrated oak. Gravenstein apple and pear dominate in flavor, adding to the overall succulence and success of this wine."
"This outstanding wine should earn the somewhat difficult grape many new fans. It opens up beautifully with ample aeration and is true to variety without giving the impression of cheap perfume, emphasizing spice over powdery scents and showing plenty of ripe fruit, from Asian pear, to pineapple to jicama."
"Smoky, savory plum, black olive and meat notes emerge on the nose and continue through the lengthy finish, framed by firm tannins. Drink now2025."
"A lovely shade of tawny gold, this is 100% Pinot Noir made as a dry white. It has plenty of body and delicious fruit that brings Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and other white wine grapes to mind without quite duplicating their flavors. However you describe it, it's delicious and a fine value besides."
"This blend of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon incorporates wonderful, spicy oak with a ripe and generous core of black fruits to a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It has plenty of oak character, but the oak is well integrated and complements the blackberry and blueberry flavors deftly."
"This biodynamic wine is a study in contrasts. Non-fruit aromas of wax, paraffin and lanolin are offset by bright pineapple flavors, while a long, zesty finish balances the wine's ample weight and slightly creamy texture. Delicious now, it should drink well through at least 2022."
"This wine combines 70% Merlot from Mount Veeder with 24% Cabernet Franc grown in Oakville and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon from Rutherford. Together, they meld juicy cedar, cranberry, currant and Old-World grip around integrated tannins and softened oak."
"This wine is rich and firmly structured. Ripe black fruits are integrated into a generous texture, full acidity and with a great base of tannins. It still needs to age. Drink from 2019."
"This lightly wood-aged wine is full of yellow fruits touched by spice. It is balanced, with good acidity to complement the fruits and with toast and minerality to give structure. It is ready to drink."
"This is the estate wine from this flagship estate of Real Companhia Velha. It is ripe and juicy, full of open, generous black fruits and balanced acidity. The structure gives it a firm character that will allow it to age. Drink this wine from 2019."
"Hefty and concentrated in flavor, with a thick layered texture, this wine is made from two blocks of the famous vineyard. Mango, apple skin and substantial background oak give it a tension between sugar and spice."
"Salty wood and brine show this vineyard's straight shot to the sea, as bright lifted acidity helps to further prove the point. Focused and tense on the palate, there's a sharp, stony minerality that comes into play here, alongside etchings of lemon peel and green apple."
"Intoxicating tropical pineapple, melon and mango flavors are accented by savory notes of chestnut, spice and saffron in this nuanced Auslese. It's decadently sweet with a rich unctuous texture, that's balanced squarely by zaps of lemon-lime acidity. The finish seems to roll on in waves of sweet honey and delicate tea tannins."
"From a great vineyard site, this wine does justice to its mountain fruit and coastal acidity, capturing both with ease. Juicy pear, apple, pineapple and a gritty minerality surround big shoulders of body and weight, as aromas of flowers puncture the fruit."
"Charred, almost burnt aromas dominate the nose on this muscular, tannic Malbec. Like the nose, this tastes largely of blackened hickory and coffee, meaning the fruit is buried under a lot of barrel weight. Drink through 2027."
"From a site situated at 1,800-feet in elevation, this is an incredibly elegant expression of this grape, blended with 15% Syrah and 10% Zinfandel. Tar, ginger, leather and oak complement blueberry and blackberry succulence around a rich, round, soft and substantial core of structure and flavor."
"This medium-bodied wine has a relatively light-garnet color and a touch of cloudiness that is accompanied by complex and attractive aromas blending cinnamon, clove, rhubarb and light wood smoke. These layered nuances flow into the flavors and fill the mouth with black-cherry and sour-cherry notes that are ripe but not too ripe, so the wine has fine balance."
"Made entirely from Nerello Mascalese, this vibrant wine opens with blue flower, red-skinned berry and thyme aromas. The fresh, juicy palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, cinnamon and licorice flavors framed by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2023."
"This juicy ready-to-drink wine is a counterpunch to those who believe Napa Cabernets are unapproachable in their early years. Black plum, blueberry juice and melted licorice aromas start the experience, then the palate picks up a peppery spice that gives depth to the black-currant and vanilla ripeness. The tannins are soft, if not weak, and the acidity is balanced."

It's a lush, expansive wine filled with dark fruitthink cassis and blueberry. Hints of asphalt, mocha and baking spices linger on the finish. Drink now2020."

"The great majority of this wine is made from old-vine grapes, planted pre-Prohibition. The age tells tales of soft leathery chewiness on the palate as swathes of cherry-syrup flavor make for a hearty velvety explosion that's lengthy and rich. Black licorice plays a part."

"Opening aromatically effusive as a rose garden, this wine takes on darker, thicker overtones of baked strawberry rhubarb as a heaviness of tannin and oak permeates the midpalate. Its youthful power should mellow as an underlying, almost carbonic freshness lurks."
"This blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in oak for 40 months, which contributes dark, woody spice to the nose, enhancing the fresh-pressed elderberry and crushed lava-rock aromas. The sip is soft at first before the tannins tighten around the dark flavors, and the acidity is powerfully fresh. Give it a tad more time for all components to marry. Drink 20192028."
"Rich, dense and full of black fruits, this wine conveys a dusty tannic character as well as mint, spice and blackberry fruitiness. Eight months of wood aging softened the structure and deepened the density of the wine. It is ready to drink."

Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2018."
"This deep, grippy wine has the bones of a mastodon. Its thick blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit carries even darker streaks of chocolate and espresso. Though still rare, Tannat is making a home for itself in Southern Oregon. It's a meaty, steak-friendly alternative to pricier Cabernets."
"This supple and succulent wine mixes red and blue fruit with a persistent peppery note. The winery's top offering, it's a barrel selection from five organically-farmed vineyards, including Chehalem Mountain vineyard. Aged for 17 months in half new French oak barrels, it fades gracefully with a touch of char."

"It's a new day for this producer, which is stepping slightly off the gas to make more nuanced balanced wines. This is no exception: a restrained offering of earthy mushroom, soy, cedar, leather and juicy red fruit that disentangles itself from oak and tannin to stay fresh in the glass. Enjoy best from 2024 through 2034."

"The nose on this bottling is immensely intriguing and unique, with gooseberry, grapefruit skin, wet river stone and the faintest whiff of serrano chili.

"Interest-stirring aromas of tea, stewed berry fruits, vanilla and oak segue into a chewy, dense palate with bulk. Savory, lightly herbal berry flavors are draped with oak character, while this Malbec tastes of grainy oak and toast on the finish. Drink through 2021."

"A pretty shade of pale pink, this dry and spicy ros has a boisterous personality. Its watermelon and strawberry flavors come with a kick, showing real depth. Juicy acidity keeps it fresh and forward."

In body and structure, this is an intense wineample crushed-velvet tannins harmoniously mesh with racy acidity and a full body. The finish is long and evolving."
"This is the entry-level wine from this biodynamic estate. It is full of flavor, ripe from the lees aging and with intense acidity to balance. It goes more to the apple side of Muscadet, producing a wine that is rich and full bodied. Drink from late 2017."

"This wine knocks the flavors out of the park again this vintage, with spicy grapefruit and pine needle notes leading the charge. Think more cool fruitlime flesh and skinthan tropical flavors. Add vivid acidity, impeccable balance and a refreshing, wet stone finish, and this is a must-have, everyday, goes-with-anything white."

"Baked plum and berry aromas are earthy, savory and a touch cheesy but not overdone. This Cabernet is more heavy and syrupy than lean. Flavors of lemony oak, brown sugar and baked berry fruits finish with fig and chocolate accents. Drink this ripe, full-bodied wine over the next couple of years."

"Aged in French oak for more than a year (20% new), this is a full-bodied and layered wine. Strong aromas of French butter and baguette dominate the nose. The midpalate offers more brightness, revealing high-toned accents of apple blossom, lemon and mango wrapped in tart acidity before returning to the richness of crme brle on the close."
"With minty wood flavors, this wine is smooth and polished. It offers berry fruits from the blend of 10 varieties in this old-vine vineyard. With spice and some firm tannins in the background, it is ready to drink."

"This is a perfumed crisp wine, attractively fruity and with delicious acidity. Its fruit is effusive and needs to calm down and fill out, so just wait until 2018 for it richness to be fully apparent."
"Waxy, dusty apple and oak aromas reflect the 30% Smillon, but this is mostly Chardonnay in quantity, style, feel and flavors. Salty melon, tropical notes and nicely laid-out oak flavors turn a touch bitter on a weighty but healthy finish. Drink this classy white blend through 2018."

This barrel-fermented wine has an aggressive toasty aroma that carries over into the flavors. Its ripe apple and buttered toast notes lead to a finish accented with coconut. A Chardonnay lover's Pinot Gris.

"The short oak aging has broadened this already ripe wine. The touch of toast is balanced by the yellow fruits and rich acidity. It is full, concentrated, mineral textured and ready to drink."
"The wine comes from a 14-acre estate owned by the producer. Its fruitiness and texture are both important elements in the wine at this young stage. They give a tightly textured wine that is still bright, crisp with lemon fruit and crispened with considerable acidity. Let the wine soften and drink from 2018."
"Fresh fruit aromas, dominated by black cherry, expand on the substantial palate. This wine is a rich, robust and ripely built expression of a dark-horse grape in these parts. Black licorice dots a jammy concentration of fruit and of the rich texture, rewarding those who like their wines powerfully packed."

"Rich aromas of molasses, chocolate and fig paste announce a ripe, thick Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. On the palate, this is grabby, intense and oaky. Flavors of oak grain, graphite, chocolate and berry fruits finish saturated and heavy, lacking elegance."
"Earthy underbrush, leather, scorched earth, dark spice and toasted hazelnut aromas lead the way. The firm palate shows dried cherry, licorice and tobacco flavors alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 20192026."
"The word scrumptious applies here. This rich and complex ros from Eric Hamacher is a mix of saigne juice and Pinot Noir blanc that wasn't quite blanc enougha happy accident, since it's packed with raspberry confit and plum jam flavors, with a hint of cranberry sauce. Coming up on two years past fermentation, it's a wine to drink now."
"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine. Its texture is there, surrounded by superripe fruit and touches of pepper from the alcohol. This almost tropical-fruit wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2018."
"This producer makes a perennial standout of the variety. It is subdued and elegant in its approach to the lengthy layered weight and the integrated fruit. Plum, cedar and black licorice form a core of flavor over soft supple tannin and peppery oak, ending in a burst of spice and leather."
"Vineyard redevelopment and a new winery contributed to this fine expression of ripe Alicante Bouschet wine under the direction of Catarina Vieira. It's rich and structured, reflecting the grape.

"Whiffs of saffron and spice lend earthen complexity to cutting lime and green plum in this zesty Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it's delicately sheer and spry. Its invigorating style is pleasurable already, but should only meld and improve from now through 2022."
"This wine offers a wealth of big flavor and plush structure within a context of savory oak and firm tannin. Black olive and licorice highlight a nicely composed framework of plum and dark cherry, dotted with fresh tobacco."
"Not a mere whole-cluster wine, the Stalker is made by drying the stalks separately and adding them to whole berries. It's slightly chalky as a result, with a green edge to the tannins and green tea flavors. Black cherry, espresso and cacao components also factor in. Give it another couple of years and drink after 2020."
"Produced from vines a half century old, this is fermented completely dry yet retains a distinct floral/talc character. Although Alsatian in style it, exudes a bit of extra fruit flesh, as one would expect of Oregon. It's a lovely wine, with rose petal scents and light peach flavors."
"Very dark purple in the glass, this bottling shows leathery red cherry, subtle nutmeg and ginger spice, a touch of baked soil and stronger caramel notes on the nose. Rich black cherry meets with vanilla on the palate, which is slathered with a strong simmering acidity that's refreshing although almost too potent."

"Crunchy red fruit is front and center in this vineyard-designate, well capturing the tone of the appellation. Raspberry, black tea and brooding tannins surround a light-bodied frame further highlighted with violet and cardamom."
"Spicy red-berry aromas with an accent of musky, cheesy oak get this Malbec-Bonarda blend moving in an interesting way. A tight, pointy palate with lean acidity houses flavors of plum and berry along with creamy oak and vanilla. Lactic oak is a factor on an otherwise bright and spicy finish."
"Consistent with many other Timothy Malone Pinots, this artfully melds black cherry fruit with a broad streak of cola and refreshing minerality. There's a touch of black licorice and impressive balance throughout."
"Impressive for its bold, savory flavors of tapenade and grilled meat, this is full boded and ripe, but lacks the density and concentration of the region's best examples, giving way to an open-knit finish. Drink this over the next several years for its upfront appeal."
"This effusive, expressive wine offers deep citrus, lemon drop, grapefruit and peach flavors. The fruit is further boosted with a powdered sugar note. Delicious already, it should drink well over the next three or four years."
"The Syrah in this blend gives an extra perfume and spice to this rich wine. Its tannins and firm structure are balanced by the black fruits, acidity and Douro minerality. This wine is ready to drink."
"With stainless steel-fermentation and time in oak, this seamless, elegant white is stony in mineral notes and inviting in aromas of white flowers. Lurking golden-honey and crme-brle richness add texture and body, while the finish becomes clear and crisp."
"Delicate aromas suggesting chopped herb, star anise, new leather and a whiff of blue flower slowly emerge in the glass. The taut, ethereal palate shows sour cherry, raw strawberry, licorice and white pepper notes hemmed in by firm acidity and youthful tannins. Drink 20232030."
"Tight in tannin weight and breadth, this big-boned wine is muscular in leather, blackberry and mocha, and robust in power and ripeness. The force of its flavor finds additional strength and length on the finish."
"A big improvement from the previous vintage, this pretty, salmon-hued wine is packed with subtle but flavorful fruit. Tart citrus and strawberry notes underscored with crisp, clean acidity make it refreshing and a real winner."
"This dry-tasting Riesling contains only 6.6 g/L of residual sugar. Balanced and fresh peach, pear and tangerine fruit flavors combine on the palate for a full, round and tasty take on the grape."
"This savory Nerello Mascalese leads with red cherry, raspberry and rosemary scents. The palate delivers red-skinned berry, cinnamon and Mediterranean scrub notes within a frame of polished tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy through 2022."
"Fermented in a seasoned 3,000-liter oak vat, this doesn't show overt wood flavors, instead revealing hints of ramps and sweat accenting passion fruit. Medium bodied, it offers fascinating textural interplay between creaminess from lees contact and vibrant acidity. Drink now."
"Dark berry aromas are smoky and stout, and overall this well-oaked Malbec gives off a sense of seriousness on the nose. In the mouth, there's tension but also balance. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are oaky but expressive. It's spicy, a touch resiny and lasting on the finish. Drink through 2019."
"Mid-weight and balanced in flavor and texture, this reserve-tier wine combines pungent jasmine aromas with flavors of crunchy green apple and Meyer lemon. The finish shows a toasty oak note, layered in a touch of salt."
"Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast."
"Dark-pink-orange in color, this wine is muted in floral tones of beauty and simplicity. Crisp, clean and simple layers of creamy vanilla are mixed with Meyer lemon and white peach. Refreshing and light on its feet, it's memorable in its stony minerality and its full embrace of citrus intrigue."
"A flinty aroma and slightly chalky texture work really well in this lean-flavored but appetizing and full-bodied wine. It's not overtly fruity, but has subtle, savory and earthy characters that are fascinating to taste, while the bone-dry balance makes it extra appetizing."
"Initial aromas of stewy prune and raisin freshen up with airing. This has a full, grabby, muscular build and flavors of brown sugar and savory berry fruits. A rich finish deals molasses notes and chewy tannins."
"Light berry fruit flavors show the fine side of the grape in this wine, bolstered by tea-like tannins. It's nicely balanced and light in body but has enough muscle to accompany light cuts of lamb or pork."
"This Barbaresco's leather, violet, crushed mint, coconut and exotic spice aromas follow through to the palate, which is bright with red cherry and coffee notes. Fine-grained tannins offer support while high-toned acidity lends balance."
Two types of wood barrels were used to age this wine: large chestnut and smaller oak. The wood shows although it does not detract from the tightly crisp and aromatic fruitiness of the Bical grape. It is lively at the end with plenty of bright acidity. Drink now.
The Arinto grape is a Lisboa specialty and this lightly wood-aged wine shows it to great advantage. Plenty of acidity and a crisp texture are balanced by vanilla and creamy apple. This fine wine is ready to drink.
"This opens with balsamic aromas of camphor, new leather, menthol and exotic spice. The tightly wound palate offers Morello cherry, cranberry, white pepper and grilled sage while assertive, close-grained tannins provide firm support."
"Crushed dill, forest floor and moist earth aromas lead this wine's nose. Its racy palate shows red cherry, strawberry compote, licorice and clove flavors framed by youthful, fine-grained tannins and brisk acidity. A hint of tobacco marks the close. Give this a few more years to mellow before drinking."

"Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California. The wine is also soft and restrained on the sip, with fresh nectarine and white-flower flavors, finishing with a familiar kiss of oak."
"This tightly wound wine offers firm purple fruit flavors, along with a touch of sweet berries. There's ample acidity and a slightly chalky finish."

"This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity."
"The winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates."
"This full-bodied wine shows smooth and rounded plum fruit. The flavors are mouth-filling, but the rather quick fade suggests it's best consumed in the near term, as it's already five years past harvest."

"Dark orange and red in color, this slightly sweet wine is simple in its offerings of ripe peach and strawberry flavor. It's a nice choice for picnics and porch gatherings."
"This concentrated but not overwhelming wine has charred-wood aromas and ripe, almost sweet blackberry and raspberry flavors. It's ripe enough to be syrupy, but doesn't go over the top."
"Inky berry, beet and oak aromas smell more worked than natural in this full-bodied Malbec that's a bit clunky on the palate. Flavors of plum, herbs and cool mint finish spicy and slightly green."

"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, crushed herb and blue flower. The palate is tightly wound and rather closed, showing hints of orange zest and raw cranberry. Racy acidity and austere tannins clench the finish."
"Tobacco leaf, black currant and cinnamon color the nose of this Merlot. Suggestions of black fruits are buried by oak flavors of cigar box, vanilla, cinnamon and tobacco on the palate. Intensely tannic, the wine finishes with a strong cigar box flavor."

"This wine has the lightest possible taste. Its hints of green fruit, light, citrusy acidity and crisp aftertaste are barely discernible. Drink now."
Matchstick and green pepper lead the aromas of this sweet-and-sour Moscato. Canned-fruit flavors bring some fruit to the palate but finish a bit syrupy.

"A cloud of otherworldly flavors enters the brain: candied pineapple, vanilla, candied peach, caramel, Mirabelle and a touch of honey. The palate presents viscous sweetness, pierced by fresh acidity that explodes completely. This is a pure, rich and aromatic Eiswein of Austria's flagship variety. Delicious now, it should cellar well through at least 2040."
"One of the world's best PX wines is Solera 1927, the pride of Alvear. Whatever solera stocks went into this bottling were well selected. Aromas of maple and fine wood turn to fig and caramel. Saturation and weight on the palate are expected, but this has some (though not a lot) acidic cut. Deep flavors of fig and Nutella finish with nuttiness and warmth. Drink or hold."

This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity.

A licorice note wraps around the tight finish. This is still primary so be sure to give it time to fully develop. Drink 20252045."
"On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup. Despite all the decadent sweetness, the finish is still lip-smacking, clean and endless."
"Candied lemon, beeswax and honey are wrapped in the sumptuous embrace of vanilla. Topnotes of passion fruit and nettle appear too, while the palate is conquered by the all-encompassing concentration of this TBA. The precise flavors have a bright, etched citrus frame that shapes and balances the sweetness. Apricot, bergamot, apple and passion fruit all make an appearance. Aromatically, the length goes on and on. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2040, at least."
"Power and grace come together in this deceptively concentrated, full-bodied, complex, sophisticated and age-worthy wine. A light hand on the new-oak nuances allows the pure, focused fruit flavors to course through on the palate and linger on the finish. It will be best after 2020."
"Dark red and black-cherry fruit is clothed in the sumptuous perfume of almost-floral new oak. Toasty oak notes also appear on the fluid and compact body. Juicy black cherry fruit at the core is edged with bright freshness. A touch of white pepper can be glimpsed through the fruit. The structure shows fine tannins, still crunching like starched velvet but beginning to yield. If you like the crunch, drink this wine now, if you like evolution, it will reward patience. The core of brilliant cherry and bluebery fruit promises to continue shining. Drink now2030."
"Leather, pipe tobacco, woodland berry, dark spice and crushed herb follow through to the taut linear palate along with notes of sour cherry, ground pepper and clove. It's extremely elegant but still tightly wound, with youthfully assertive tannins that need to unfold. Give this time to come together and develop complexity. Drink 20222032."
"Menthol, pressed rose, iris, woodland berry, chopped mint and a whiff of oak-driven spice take center stage. It's still tight, with youthfully assertive refined tannins but it also boasts layers of red cherry, raspberry compote, cranberry, licorice and vanilla alongside bright acidity. Thanks to its age-worthy structure, you'll need patience for this one. Drink 20282048."
"This is a complex and layered Mourvdre. Fragrances of rose petals, cinnamon, mace, blackberry and black cherry prove almost overpowering, yet delicious.

Young and balanced, it will be even better with more bottle age. Drink 20232043."
"Aromas of red berry, rose petal, blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of espresso lift out of the glass along with a menthol note. The taut vibrant palate offers crushed strawberry, tart cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins. It's extremely elegant but still youthfully austere at this stage so give it several more years to unwind. Drink 20232038."
"Wild berry, crushed herb, violet and baking spice scents lift out of the glass along with a whiff of menthol. Focused and elegantly structured, the delicious palate doles out ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon, sage and white pepper, while refined tannins and bright acidity provide supple support and impeccable balance. Drink 20232033."
"A musky note of botrytis makes for a heady, lifted nose, followed by aromas of dark fir honey and candied pineapple. The palate adds an almost grassy, herbal tinge to the proceedings, creating an intriguing edge amid the killer sweetness. The mouthfeel is dense and sticky, but bright. On the finish an array of fruit breaks loose: tart apple, apple jelly, candied grapefruit peel and candied lemon. The sweet finish lingers."
"Apple and passion fruit are the aromatic top notes, hovering above a nose of honey and musk.

"The musky touch of botryrtis clings to the mellow, sweet ripeness of juicy Mirabelle plums and candied citrus on the nose. The palate follows with a supremely balanced sweetness that's nonetheless bright and luminous with lemony freshness. A floral perfume fills the palate with a fragrance that lasts and lasts."
"As is often the case, a poor red wine vintage in Bordeaux is a good year for sweet wines. This unctuous wine, still young and dominated by 95% Smillon, is beautifully balanced. Its honey and botrytis flavors give it a dry edge that comfortably contrasts with the opulent sweetness. The acidity, a source of freshness, gives the wine the lift it needs. Drink this serious and major wine from 2023."
"Almost as big as a Port, but not sweet, this densely concentrated but surprisingly gentle wine offers opulent, ripe and almost jammy berry flavors that coat the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth long after each sip. It's technically dry, but so rich with blackberry and cassis flavors that it seems sweet from the first aroma to the lingering finish. It will be best after 2024."
"Beguiling scents of fragrant berry, rose petal, baking spice, new leather and aromatic herbs swirl around in the glass. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, doling out morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and star anise, while polished tannins and bright acidity provide impeccable balance.

It's a voluptuous, attention-grabbing wine."
"Tremendously delicious, this bottling combines hedonistic flair with elegant depth, satisfying both carnal and intellectual desires. Waves of hot cherry pie with vanilla ice cream and cola spice show on the nose, but the sip grows more dry and refined. Black cherry is enhanced with crushed nutmeg, black pepper and a pinch of dill, balanced via underlying acidity and a leathery tannic frame."
"This is a gentle giant of a wine, so packed with flavor and drenched with ripe tannins that it literally coats the palate. Clove, cedar and blackberry fill the aroma, while dark chocolate, spiced cherries and blackberries flood the flavors. While full bodied and richly tannic, it maintains fabulous balance, and is destined for a long life in the cellar. Best from 20242035."
"This is a big, gutsy, but far from overpowering wine that's nearly opaque in color. Packed with dark chocolate and violet aromas, it pours out black cherry and blackberry flavors from a deep well. Well-integrated tannins give good grip on the palate and perfectly support the ripeness and richness of the fruit. It will be best after 2023."
"Intensely fragrant, this offers enticing scents of woodland berry, violet, rose, aromatic herb and new leather. Elegantly structured, the linear palate is all about finesse, delivering red cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and licorice framed in firm refined tannins. Drink 20222032."

"Beautiful aromas of ripe red cherry and cherry blossoms mix with rose-laced potpourri, dust, cola and vanilla on the nose of this best-barrel bottling by Jim Clendenen, named after his daughter.

The interaction between these opposing poles creates tension in this lip-smacking, lemony- bright wine."

Known to age well for decades, this Concannon classic will be best from 2022."
"Stout, leathery aromas of black fruits and grilled meats are blackened and a true reflection of Syrah. This is expansive on the palate, but also acidic and abrasive.

"Although it effectively disappeared from Bordeaux after phylloxera, Malbec hung on in Blaye on the north side of the Gironde Estuary. This wine, part of a single-parcel (lieu dit in French) single-varietal range, is richly structured and powerfully dense. It has great tannins and also bold ripe black fruits. Drink this concentrated wine from 2020."
"Red plum, dark cranberry, composting rose petals, dried ginger and earthy mushrooms show on the slightly funky, slightly sweet nose of this bottling. The palate begins with a sour plum skin and tart raspberry kick, then leads into a core with hints of pine needle, juniper and turned loam."
"Restrained mulberry aromas interweave with scents of turned soil, white pepper and clove on the earthy nose of this bottling. The sip starts with a pleasing softness but quickly grows deeper and more weighty with luxurious tannins, showing hearty red cherry and dried fennel flavors."
"An attractive mix of spiced plum, fresh tomato, herb, tobacco and vanilla aromas are the intro to this excellent wine from a not-good vintage. The palate is creamy but vital, with roasted plum, integrated oak and savory flavors. A smooth but intense finish brings this home. Drink through 2019."
"Intriguing aromas of saltwater taffy, churned butter, lemon drop and cotton candy show on the dairy-powered nose of this bottling of the historic vineyard by the Duckhorn-related producer. Lemon cream and white-peach flavors show on the sip, where a strong salty character cuts through."
"There is a very accessible aromatic entry to this bottling. An almost-sweet touch of crystallized honey and beeswax is cut by green plum, wet stone and chopped lemongrass. The sip delivers rounded and pleasant flavors of nectarine, red apple and chamomile."
"At six years of age, this wine shows a gorgeous nose of smoked meats, blueberries and espresso. It's medium to full in body, with a long, dusty finish. This wine is still firmly tannicit probably will always have a dry edge to itbut pair it with grilled or roasted lamb or beef and it should be fine. Drink now2028."
"Spicy notes of miso and yeast appear first on the nose. The palate, full with vivid spritz, amplifies them even more. Bright lemon notes provide freshness, createing a lively, almost warming but still refreshing Grner that is all about total savoriness, spice and verve."
"A touch of honeysuckle works its way through the peachy, lemony nose of this indigenous Austrian. The palate brings out peach and a perfumed, rose-scented phenolic edge. Although the texture is rounded, the palate is fresh and firm. Ripeness and exuberance are coralled into lively and very appetizing freshness."
"This is the first vintage of this designated wine, grown on a high-elevation vineyard called William Wesley, near Annapolis. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of smoke create synergy around a medium-bodied core of soft, velvety texture and a crisp seasoning of white pepper."
"Aromatic hints of russet and yellow pear appear first, followed by lemon freshness. The palate holds all of these, accentuating the freshness with a touch of fine spritz. White pepper shimmers around the edges and the slightest phenoloc grip creates a fresh and slender body. This has a light touch but a lastingly clean finish."
"Greg Brewer resurrects his briefly shuttered brand to show what can be done on the floral edge of Chardonnay. This bottling that is very light in the glass offers tons of boisterous fruit displayed with delicacy, including tuberose, orange blossoms, lime and ripe pears. Guava powers the sip along with coconut, mango and apple-blossom flavors, wrapped in a tantalizing acidity. It would go great with sushi."
"Very smooth and flavorful, this full-bodied wine pairs excellent concentration of dark-fruit flavors with subtle accents of both dark and milk chocolate. Classic varietal cues of black olive, black cherry and a faint hint of rosemary make it complex and interesting to taste. The mouthfeel strikes a good balance between firm, fine-grained tannins and a posh richness that helps the finish linger. Best after 2024."
"Dark, tangy black-plum skin and tart boysenberry meet with purple flowers and rosemary on the nose of this bottling, which promises plenty of life in the cellar. The palate is lightly bodied but firmly structured, with tannic depth upholding the dark purple fruits and subtle black spice. These flavors will concentrate and intensify with time. Drink 20182025."
"This is a big, dry and compelling wine made from an unusual combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvdre and Zinfandel. Wood smoke and black-pepper aromas join quite ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors, while firm tannins support full body and all that wonderful richness. It's perfect for a casual meal headlined by a slab of beef."
"Syrah is a relative rarity from this appellation. Harvested at one ton per acre, this one brings light aromas of earth, white pepper, herb and smoked meat. It's palate coating, with reserved red fruit and spice flavors that bring a compelling sense of texture. There's no apparent new oak influence, keeping the focus on the fruit. Put it on the dinner table and it will shine."
"This opens with aromas of pressed rose petal, underbrush, truffle, white pepper and leather. The already approachable palate delivers juicy black cherry, cooking spice and licorice. Drink through 2022."
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (41%), Merlot (26%), Cabernet Franc (22%) and Petit Verdot from Firethorn, Bacchus, DuBrul, Dionysus, Kiona and XL vineyards, the aromas are all high toned, with notes of char, coffee grounds, plum, herb, barrel spice and vanilla. The coffee, cherry and dark-fruit flavors are concentrated but lithe, showing a mesmerizing sense of balance."
"Although not labeled as such, this is 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot. Aromas of dried herb, black currant, pipe tobacco, cassis, black licorice and blackberry pie give way to pitch-black tightly wound fruit flavors. It shows exquisite concentration and richness, with enough acid and tannin to go the distance."
"Aromas of raspberry compote, vanilla, clove and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this structured red. The firm yet elegant palate shows dark cherry, cranberry, licorice, chopped herb and mineral. Fresh acidity and polished fine-grained tannins lend balance and finesse. Drink 20182027."
"There is an impressive, laser-focused minerality on the nose of this bottling, as an aroma of just-carved limestone meets with slivers of strawberry, peach, citrus and apple. A tart red-melon character shows on the citrus-laced palate, where the bubbles are light as air."
"Fat red cherries and red plums are laid across slate and star anise on the nose of this bottling based on a historic clone. There is solid tension to the sip, with rocky, grippy minerality framing hibiscus, pomegranate and chaparral flavors."
"This is an engaging, nervy wine, with a light, savory aroma and tangy red-cherry flavors riding on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and good acidity. It does not try to overwhelm with superripe fruit or oak, but just lets the purity of the grapes shine through."
"Petit Verdot makes up a full 62% of this wine, with the rest Merlot (18%), Cabernet Sauvignon (10%), Malbec (5%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas offer notes of blackberry, Fruit Roll-Ups, herb, dark soil and flower. The palate brings cherry flavors, bright acids and chewy tannins. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
"The Gonet family's investment, which began in 1998, has begun to bear fruit. This wine comes from the second in a row of fine Bordeaux vintages. The style of the vintage is well represented in this richly endowed wine with its swathes of black fruits, its rich tannins and its warm full texture. This is just coming together after a quiet period for the vintage. Drink from 2018."
"This wine is firm with solid tannins. It has rich fruit and concentration with layers of blackberry and dark plums. It comes from a small seven-acre property and is aged for 15 months in wood. This impressive wine needs to age, so drink from 2022."
"Eric Carucci taps a very cool-climate, biodynamic vineyard originally planted by Syrah legend Bob Lindquist to deliver this tightly wound, age-worthy wine, full of black pepper, tar, violet and dense black currants on the nose. The tart black-plum skins, boysenberry and purple flower notes on the sip need time to develop as do the squeaky tannins, but tons of potential greatness awaits. Drink 20192029."
"Espresso, toast, new leather, menthol and French oak aromas take center stage. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and sage alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins."
"This ripe, boldly made wine offers a rich tease of Dr Pepper that pleases the palate, before complex characteristics takes over. Black tea, forest floor, currant and spicy acidity are memorably interwoven with dense black fruit."
"A touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose. The palate is both firm and fruity. This wine is gorgeously ripe, with aromatic fruit captured at the perfect moment. It has grip and muscle, along with juicy, firm freshness that lets the dark and almost brooding black cherry, blueberry and blackberry fruit speak. On the finish, peppery spice appears amid the berries and bright freshness."
"Slightly overripe aromas of raisin and prune dominate the nose on this jammy, spongy-feeling gran reserva. Soft, ripe cassis and plum flavors come with spice and tobacco accents. On a savory finish, prune comes back into play, thus cementing a ripe, jammy essence. Drink through 2025."
"Cedar, violet and red forest fruit aromas start this complex and stately red. On the palate, cherry, plum and pepper prevail. A classic wine with potential in the cellar."
"From the highest-elevation spot within the producer's Conn Creek vineyard, this wine is sticky and grippy in coffee, red cherry and billowing tannins that reach a soft, round approachability. The finish is part chocolate, part vanilla, both in proportion and in balance, the wine ultimately full of grace."
"The aromas are generous, with notes of spice box, blue and purple fruit, pencil lead, barrel spice and vanilla. It's silky and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of texture and an extended finish."
"This wine is 82% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, coming from Cold Creek and Four Feathers vineyards. Designed with the specific intent of aging, brooding aromas of blue and red fruit, earth and spice lead to a saturated seamless palate. It drinks beautifully now, but should have a long life in front of it. Best after 2022."
"Perfumed in smoky oak, this 100% varietal wine is nuanced and well rounded. Expressive in dark, brooding flavors of baked cherry and cedar, it has a persistent, gritty texture that impresses through the spicy, peppery end."
"Gerin's lieu-dit wines from 2013 are both successful. Les Grandes Places is muscular but not musclebound, combining finesse and elegance with elements of roasted meat and grilled fruit. After 20 months in new oak, the nose reveals hints of baking spices, but those are balanced by blueberry and pepper elements. Drink 20182028."
"Both the juicy and the tart notes of ripe apple and freshly cut apple peel play on the nose. The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous. The finish is delicate and the wine seems just off dry, although it is a proper late-harvest style. It would be an absolute winner with soft cheeses."
"This boasts intense aromas of crushed thyme, new leather and a balsamic note of camphor. Firmly structured but elegant, the linear palate offers dried sour cherry, tobacco, clove and sage set against assertive, close-grained tannins. Drink 20212031."
"This wine comes from a recently planted area of valley, high on a ridge top. A blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec, the aromas boast high-toned notes of mineral, herb, cherry, licorice and dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and richness. It shows well now, but should only get better with some additional time in the bottle."
"Finding ripe Petit Verdot outside the Mdoc in Bordeaux is unusual. And then to make an 100% varietal wine is very rare. It is a rich wine without being excessive. Its tannins and structure are firm, backed up by black fruits that will surely develop as the wine matures. Drink this success story from 2020."
"Ripe blueberry with a dusting of cinnamon makes for an enticing, inviting nose. These flavors also dominate the juicy palate, where fine tannins weave a delicate web of support. Freshness balances the rich fruit, showcasing a juicy, berry-ish wine that is more than just fruit-driven. Structure and aroma resonate on the long finish."
"There's the ever-so-slight touch of pink to the glass in this bottling by Bruno D'Alfonso, who packs strong and fresh aromas of cider apples, chalk, tangerine zest, pear flesh and light jasmine on the nose. There is tons of energy on the palate, tightening up before unleashing poached Asian pear, lime spritzer and red apple flavors."
"This Gironde-inspired blend of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Smillon is solid now, but will be far more interesting in the years to come. Aromas of wet slate and wet wool meet with Pink Lady apples and green, grassy meadows on the nose. The mineral-focused palate shows graphite and steel touches, with angular grass tones that lead into a warmed touch of toast on the finish. Drink 20182025."
"Dense, dark aromas of minty oak, blackberry, pencil lead and chocolate set up a broad, hard-bodied palate with firm, gripping tannins. Toasty blackberry and pronounced oak flavors culminate on a big, lush and grabby finish. This is excellent, though a bit bold and burly; drink through 2022."
"Tropical and slightly reduced, this complex wine from the famous Westside Road site is peachy and dripping in caramel. Baked apple adds to the lush, plush and richly robust palate, which finishes with balanced acidity and a taste of salty pretzel."
"The aromas are almost completely closed up at present, occasionally revealing notes of barrel spice, dried cherries, herb and dark fruit. The palate displays a sense of elegance and nuance, showing pleasing subtleties. Give it some time in the cellar to for the wood to integrate and the fruit to blossom. Best after 2023."
"Ripe cassis and berry aromas come with common Rioja side notes of vanilla, cedar and tobacco. This wine feels flush, with plenty of weight but also balance. Flavors of raisin, prune, cassis, chocolate and vanilla finish full, toasty and warm. This is a ripe reserva made in the classic Rioja style; drink through 2025."
True ice wines are a rarity in the Northwest. This one brings honeyed aromas of dried pineapple and mango that draw you into the glass. The flavors are sweet and rich but still manage to remain light on their feet. It's a perfect end to any meal.
"Black cherry, currants and plums on the nose lead into a delicious balance of olive, plums and herbs on the palate. Dried currants, crushes stone and leather are also in the mix, with a chalky finish keeping the wine on track. Keep this one in the cellar or drink now with lamb or olive tapenade."
"This wine is 61% Syrah and 39% Mourvdre. Appealing aromas of red and black fruit, mineral, spice, earth and braised meat lead to a full bodied, still quite tightly wound palate. All the stuffing is there but it needs some additional time in bottle or a short decant to open up."
"Coming from one of the strongest vintages of the last decade and with a full five years in bottle, this blend of Pepper Bridge (60%) and Minnick Hills fruit brings aromas of smoke, barrel spice, cranberry, cherry and dark berry. The dark-fruit flavors are rich, luscious and palate coating. It brings a sense of hedonism and balance that is impossible to ignore."
"This fragrant wine will entice with you its heady perfume of woodland berry, wild herb, graphite and blue flower. It's still quite young and tightly wound, delivering strawberry, cherry, white pepper and thyme wrapped up in taut tannins. Vibrant acidity provides balance and energy but give this time to fully develop. Drink 20232033."
"Rooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are oaky and toasty, like burnt bread crust. This reserva feels weighty, but well balanced. Spicy currant and plum flavors are racy and improve on an elegant finish that doesn't overreach. Drink through 2026."
"Ripe-tasting spiced-plum flavors and a generous texture make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy at first sip, and it offers even more payoff with continued tasting. It delivers plenty of fruit character, accented by complex cinnamon, clove and nutmeg spices and a grand feeling of breadth on the palate."
"BJ Fazeli's blend of 30% Shiraz (the spelling is a nod to his Persian roots), 30% Petite Sirah, 26% Merlot and 14% Zinfandel offers deep blackberry, black pepper, dried purple flowers and a pinch of herbs on the nose. The black fruit of the palate is spiced heavily with cardamom and clove. The rising acidity and firm structure show most on the finish."
"Interest is stirred right away by tarry aromas of wild berry fruits and rooty spices. The solid palate is creamy while also showing its teeth. Toasty, spicy baked-berry flavors are integrated and finish long and dry, with a touch of latent oak. Drink at any point through 2032."
"A blend of fruit from the 1991 and 1986 block at this esteemed vineyard, the aromas are locked up on first pour, with notes of raspberry, olive, black licorice, smoked meat and herb. The palate brings a thoroughly enchanting feel and sense of texture, with a sense of tension and purity of fruit flavors. Give it time to open up."
"This wine is tight as a drum at present. Brooding aromas of iron, black cherry, pomegranate, bacon fat, spice and cured meat lead to concentrated full superpolished dark-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of intensity and deliciousness that is impossible to ignore."
"The nose is still shy but the palate has an almost-fizzing freshness that speaks of a multitude of aromas: green-apple peel, green-pear flesh, a touch of yeast and a salty, savory, peppery edge of miso. This is compact with a good creamy core in its slender and slinky body, but full of flavor and verve."
"Robustly spicy in cardamom and cinnamon cola, this wine explodes in dark berry fruit, its medium-bodied layers smoothed and velvety on the palate. From one of the more prominent sites within the Petaluma Gap's wind tunnel, this wine has a coastal influence of salty air about it."
"Lifted lime and lemon notes appear on the shy nose, edged with soy spice. The palate follows with ripe, beautifully drawn pear fruit and even more yeasty, savory miso. Texturally this has a creamy lick and sleek midpalate concentration. The long, lovely finish brings out earthiness, pear peel and hints of lovage and chervil."
"Aromas suggesting ripe berry, espresso, pressed rose and a whiff of camphor slowly take shape. The palate is focused but still extremely tight, offering morello cherry, dried sage and a hint of dark spice alongside assertive close-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Give the tannins several more years to unclench then drink."
"The shy nose gives mere glimpses of zesty lemon. The palate seems to have a stony, earthy core, a central point from which freshness and impact radiate. This is incredibly juicy and mouthwatering, slowly showing ripe Mirabelle fruit framed by juicy, ripe lemon and tangerine notes. The body is dry, light and mouthwatering, while the whistle-clean finish reels you in with its juiciness."
"Underbrush, truffle, baking spice, leather and tobacco aromas segue over to the smooth full-bodied palate along with raspberry jam, licorice and clove. Seasoned polished tannins provide elegance and structure. Drink through 2027."
"Rose, violet, crushed mint and red-berry scents mingle together in the glass. On the tight palate, bright acidity and taut fine-grained tannins frame cherry, strawberry, star anise and dried herb. It's a great introduction to this classic vintage. Drink 20212028."
"Round and harmonious on the palate, this wine is a terrific value. Floral notes mark the nose, backed up by raspberry and strawberry fruit, while an undercurrent of crushed stone provides depth and backbone. The finish is berry-filled, but balanced and savory."
"Lush and generous, this is textbook Condrieu from the appellation's largest producer. Subtle ginger notes add an exotic edge to the ripe apricot, mango and lychee flavors, then persist on the long finish. Drink now2018."
"Dark mulberry, black raspberry, wet slate and a touch of whole nutmeg show on the nose of this bottling by a Chicago-based winery from a vineyard that now goes by the name Shokrian. It's dry and tart on the sip, full of sour wild berries along with lots of sage and thyme, culminating in a cola and candied-plum finish."
"Leaving Bordeaux for the Mdoc, this is the first estate along the road. The wine is structured and firm, with some solid tannins as well as generous blackberry fruit. The wood aging and spice balance the blueberry and blackberry fruits. The wine should age well; drink from 2021."
The Bordeaux outpost of the Jackson family winery has produced a rich wine in this vintage. It is structured with swathes of ripe black fruits. The tannins promise some serious aging for this complex ripe wine with its solid texture. Drink from 2023.
"Quite light in color with almost an orange hue, this wine brings exuberant aromas of white pepper, fresh herb, red fruit, stem, smoked meat and potpourri. The palate is light, elegant and transparent in style with vibrant fruit, spice and savory flavors that linger on the extended finish and kick it up a notch. The oak influence is dialed way back. It delivers a lot of enjoyment on its own but should really sing at the dinner table."
"A pithy tangerine aroma meets with yellow melon, sharp lemon and lime rinds, oak shavings and yeasty toast on the nose of this bottling by Christian Roguenant. There is a sharpness to the palate, with strong acidity and a grippy texture framing margarita-like flavors of salt and citrus."
"Savory aromas of black pepper, leather and sandalwood provide depth to the core mulberry fruit on this clonal selection. Rounded flavors of black plums and dark berries are lifted by sagebrush, dried ginger and Christmas spice on the palate that offers layers and layers of depth."
"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with scents of violet, perfumed berry, crushed herb and a whiff of tilled earth. The bright elegant palate conveys raspberry, cherry, licorice and cinnamon framed in firm, refined tannins. Drink 20192026."
"Aromas of rose, crushed herb, red berry and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. Elegant, fresh and poised, the palate offers black raspberry, red cherry baking spice and a hint of licorice framed in youthful but polished tannins. Drink 20202028."
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of blackberry, black currant, herb and spice lead to rich ripe hedonistic black-fruit flavors that bring a compelling sense of texture. It's not shy, but for those looking for a big bold ripe wine, this one's for you."
"The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of cherry, herb, smoke and graphite. The black-fruit flavors, in contrast, are rich and full, bringing a sense of hedonism. It brings plenty of appeal now but should bring even more if the aromas open up."
"Hefty tannins are resolved into a velvety texture by the intense fruit and cedar flavors in this full-bodied, beautifully made wine. Notes like blueberry, dark chocolate and cocoa powder coat the palate and linger on the finish. It's thick and tannic in mouthfeel, but those tannins feel rounded and generous."
"Fresh aromas of salty lemon cream, wet slate and riverstones, as well as a touch of slightly sour yogurt, show on the nose of this bottling from the vineyard named after Fess Parker's daughter, who now runs much of the company. The lively palate combines squeezes of citrus with a creamy mouthfeel that offers hints of nuts and orangesicle. It's a very cohesive wine."
"The freshness of green citrus, pale yellow fruit and dewy summer meadows plays on the nose. The earthier palate focuses on textured savoriness reminiscent of miso and soy, counterpointed by lemon freshness. Savor slowly so you do not miss anything going on in the concentrated, slender body. It finishes on a savory lemon note."
"Fresh pear peel, ripe pear fruit and a touch of citrus make for an inviting, appetizing nose. The palate takes all this fruit as a backdrop on which to display both herb and spice: white pepper, chervil, miso and salt. This interplay of spice and fruit is savory, slender and vivid, giving a moreish, totally balanced wine."
"The 4% Viognier shows prominently, with perfumed aromas of fresh flowers and orange peel out in front of plum, purple fruit and smoked meat. The fruit flavors are sweet and saturated, with the dial turned way up. It brings a sense of deliciousness that is impossible to ignore."
"This is a classic, concentrated but elegant wine, from the wonderful black cherry and forest underbrush aromas to the ripe fruit flavors, full body and polished texture. Aging in 30% new Hungarian barrels gave a subtle spicy accent."
"A faint touch of hazelnut plays on the lemon aromas of the nose. The palate has a lingering combination of the two, plus a zesty, phenolic texture that has slight but pleasantly bitter edges plus more fruit, akin to ripe, yellow apple. This is a rounded Pinot Blanc with potential. Drink now2022."
"Aromas show new leather, iris, balsamic notes and aromatic herb. Elegant and structured, the smooth taut palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, clove and a hint of licorice set against tightly knit polished tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it a few more years to let it bloom into a beauty."
"Milagros means miracles, and the marvel is how good this wine is considering how rough in general 2013 was in the Ribera del Duero region. Oaky aromas of root beer and blackberry are smooth and heady. This wine is intense, with big tannins and firm acidity. Faith will be rewarded down the line with potent berry and chocolaty oak flavors. Bottle age should help this soften up; drink from 20202030."
"Subtle aromas of dark berry, espresso, exotic spice and French oak slowly take shape on this. The firmly structured palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, coffee and licorice while close-grained tannins provide an assertive backbone. Drink 20232033."
"From an historic block of the famous vineyard long known as Robert's Block, this white is incredibly complex and concentrated, with richly woven layers of pear, Key lime and peach. A handful of Smillon is blended in, adding extra oomph and flavor, the finish balanced in acidity and marked by freshness."
"With 94% Syrah and 6% Viognier and coming from the Rocks District, this wine brings aromatically expressive aromas of green olive, fresh violet, sea salt, black pepper, orange peel and earthy funk. The palate is soft and silky in feel, showing an appealing sense of balance and restraint. It delivers a sense of elegance."
"Inspired by the Loire Valley, where the rocks decide (as this bottling's name suggests), this wine is very light and almost cloudy in color, and shows tons of chalk, wet wool, lime peel and seashore on the nose. The texture is immensely intriguing, presenting flavors of just-ripe Anjou pear, cut grass, and iodine-like kelp tones, with a flash of petrol on the finish."
"Made with rare native grape Centesimino (organically farmed) and fermented in amphora, this has intense, alluring aromas that recall dark-skinned berry, violet, rose and dark baking spice. The bright juicy palate delivers ripe morello cherry, red currant, clove and graphite alongside tangy acidity and lithe tannins."
"The nose still gives away little. The palate also remains tightly curled in itself. This wine needs a little time but promises to blossom with another year of bottle age. It has a gamy streak on the firm, grippy midpalate as well as bright, enlivening freshness. The finish is lip-smacking and the tannins still edgy, but the juiciness of dark fruit is undeniable. Drink 20182020."
"The bright, tart flesh of early-season apples tingles enticingly on the nose. The palate follows with tart sweetness, mimicking the sweet but refreshing crunch of a ripe but tart apple. The body is delicate, with a balance that teeters between sweet and tart. Totally refreshing, it finishes with lasting echoes of apple."
"All coming from Block 1, this wine was fermented 65% whole cluster and aged for 20 months in neutral barrels. Pretty aromas of spice, flower, herb, cherry and earth give way to a full fruit-forward palate that shows a dazzling sense of purity and richness while also maintaining its restraint. It's a bit of a stylistic departure for the winery in terms of its richness but it still delivers big time."
"Aromatic notions of summer blossom and freshly cut pear appear on the nose. The palate brings out ripe, rounded and juicy pear notes alongside a textured, slightly phenolic midpalate that adds backbone. Rounded with rich fruit, it has a briskly clean finish."
"A touch of peach is edged with leafy notes of citrus foliage and a touch of elderflower. The palate brings out the peach but also a zestiness reminiscent of grapefruit peel, making for a crisp texture. Full of flavor this has a rounded midpalate despite the slender body."
"Earthy aromas of juniper and forest floor give depth to the rusty cherry, tart cranberry, dried hibiscus and pepper-dust scents on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Soft in structure at first, it then delivers a firmer tannic edge in the midpalate, all the while delivering vivacious red fruit and pine-forest flavors. It will age very well."
"Fresh lime and ivy hits you first, followed by a leesy hint and some pear on the nose. The palate comes in with salty savoriness that suggests yeasty miso, chervil and lovage, with lots of white pepper accented by a little spritz. Brightened by fresh lemon notes, this makes for a spicy, elegant and slender wine with a light touch and real depth."
"Savory aromas of roasting meat and beef jerky are enhanced by pretty touches of lilacs, violet and chocolate syrup on the nose of this bottling. The slightest kiss of strawberry shows on the sip, followed by riper blackberry, purple flowers, rosemary and pepper. The firm tannic structure ensures ageability."
"Intense, rubbery aromas of blackberry, cassis and raisin lead off. This Tinto Fino is full bodied, saturated and ripe in feel. Blackberry, cassis, toast and chocolate flavors finish with a covering of burnt oak and spice. Drink through 2026."
"Pure notes of Conference pear appear with the first whiff on the nose and then stay throughout the palate. They are joined by bright and zesty lemon freshness on a concentrated yet very streamlined body. A touch of spritz accentuates that bright lemon and green-pear delicacy even more. Very fresh, very invigorating, it's totally delicious."
"Drawn from the cooperative's oldest plantings of Marsanne, this is a rich, barrel-fermented wine with ample weight. Flavors resemble stone fruit and melon, balanced by subtle notes of toasty oak. Concentration and intensity come through on the long, mouthwatering finish."
"Enticing scents of violet, rose, new leather, perfumed berry and aromatic herb are front and center. Full-bodied and elegant, the taut structured palate delivers morello cherry, raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. It's still youthfully austere and needs time to fully come around. Drink 20232038."
"The fruit for this lovely wine hails from Sangiacomo Vineyard in Carneros. It offers a wealth of tangy, thirst-quenching lemon, blood orange and strawberry, so good and dry. Floral on the nose, it stands up on the palate in medium-bodied strength, finishing dry."
"A fine example of white Hermitage, Guigal's 2012 offers mellow, ripe stone-fruit aromas. It's medium to full in body, with flavors that suggest toasted marshmallow, stone fruit and anise hyssop. That licorice note extends through the long finish, giving the wine a refreshing quality. Drink now2025."
"A rich hint of Golden Delicious apples appears first, followed by lively notes of ripe but fresh citrus and juicy Mirabelle plums. The palate has the same juiciness of fresh stone fruit, framed by lemon freshness but also slightness and elegance. This is light bodied, dry and very fresh, with a lovely edge of grapefruit-peel zestiness. The finish is whistle-clean and long."
"This is an excellent Central Coast Chardonnay, from a cool, coastally influenced growing region. Browned butter, sea salt, nectarine and vanilla meet with sharp lemony freshness on the nose, while the medium-bodied palate is familiar and easy to quaff."
"This well-balanced Pinot Noir shows red-cherry fruit, with complex hints of anise, star anise, thyme and even tarragon on the nose. Both the acidity and tannic structure are lively but not aggressive, carrying tart cherry flavors deep into the finish."
"Full, robust layers of black cherry and peppery tannins figure prominently on the palate of this fruit-forward wine that also manages to be lively in acidity. Spicy clove, black pepper and toasted oak add complexity and depth."
"A luscious nose of chocolate-covered cherries and black pepper start this delicious Kostifali from one of Crete's wine champions. On the palate, ample flavors of black cherry, cocoa and soft spices give the wine equal parts heft and finesse. This wine has more aging life in it but is excellent now."
"This full-bodied and relatively pale-colored wine offers a pretty combination of light cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. A sweet-seeming ripeness adds to the luxurious texture. Firm acidity and a backdrop of fine-grained tannins balance it out and counter the richness beautifully."
"Rose, chopped mint, red berry and new leather aromas slowly take shape on this fragrant red. Elegant and precise, the palate delivers Marasca cherry, raspberry, licorice and pink peppercorn set against fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A coffee note backs up the close. Drink 20232033."
"Aromas of pear, lees and tropical fruit lead to a rich flavorful palate, absolutely loaded with tropical-fruit flavors that show a delightful sense of balance. The oak usage (25% new French) is judicious, allowing the fruit to shine."
"Late disgorged, this wine combines 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay from the vintage, exploding in well-honed, equal flavors of strawberry and white peach. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh and lively as it builds toward a dry, lemony finish."
"This wine has excellent depth, concentration and an array of subtle spices that mingle with lightly toasted oak, ripe plum and mulled-cherry flavors. Good acidity and a tart edge to the fruit lend nice balance against the full, velvety texture and rich finish."
"The nose is still closed and shy, while the palate speaks of ripe but tart cherry and blueberry fruit, coralled into a fine, firm tannic structure. Inherent freshness makes this wine bright and bold, lending precision and promise. The wine needs to mellow but all is there: fruit and firmness, tone and brightness. Crunchy and lovely right now, this will relax soon. Drink 20182025."
"This wine is 52% Cabernet Sauvignon and 48% Merlot. The aromas bring brooding notes of barrel spice, black cherry, licorice and herbs. The flavors are palate coating and intense, showing a compelling sense of texture and richness."
"A smoky, flinty touch of reduction joins ripe notes of green and yellow pear on the nose. The palate lets the pear fruit come to the fore but also presents a wonderfully textured body with a creamy, yeasty element and hints of ripe grapefruit. Zesty and fresh, the finish gives equal consideration to earthy and fruity elements."
"Like most Tavels, this is a dark ros, almost a light red rather than pink. It's full bodied and ripe without being overdone, boasting seductive notes of crushed stone, dried spices, dried flowers and red berries that finish with a mouthwatering squirt of lime juice."
"This wine is a blend of 57% Syrah, 29% Grenache and 14% Mourvdre. It brings the funk, along with notes of earth, grilled asparagus, stem, herb, bacon fat and green and black olive. The palate brings plenty of smoked meat and other savory flavors that glide on the warm finish. This wine offers a lot of quality and value. For those looking for a funky red wine, look no further."

"This twist-top, widely available bottling packs both fun and elegance into the bottle. It starts with aromas of freshly smashed red cherries, vanilla cake and sharp mace on the nose. Fresh energy marks the grippy palate, where layered flavors move from tart cherries to salt and pepper, then thyme and brown spice."
"Blended with 6% Marsanne, the aromas are light (considering the appellation and producer), bringing notes of herb, smoked meat, white pepper, mineral and earth. The flavors are tart and bright, creating a real sense of freshness and vibrancy."
"Full bodied and opulent, yet remarkably refreshing at the same time, wines like this are why the commune of Laudun is so highly regarded as a white-wine terroir within the warm Southern Rhne. Honey, pineapple and stone fruit notes linger through the finish, balanced by hints of crushed stone and citrus. Drink now."
"Pretty and pink, this light-bodied but nervy wine brims with white raspberry and pomegranate flavors and a texture that is crisp and mouth-cleansing. The balance between fruitiness and acidity is precise and appetizing, so it pays off sip after sip. It was made from Grenache, Mourvdre, Roussanne and Grenache Blanc."
"This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors."
"An elegantly integrated dark-red-cherry component distinguishes the nose of this blend of 40% Mourvdre, 35% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 5% Counoise, with hints of sagebrush and baking spice. The food-friendly palate combines dark-berry flavors with dried herbs, graphite and light sarsaparilla, with well-integrated acidity and a silky yet firm texture."
"A touch of lemon zest, a hint of lime, a suspicion of yeast: the nose of this wine is fresh and restrained. Light but juicy, the body ripples with refreshing ease across the tongue. It's a slender, pure and uplifting wine with zestiness and enduring, almost-weightless freshness."
"A lively whiff of white blossom, Muscat grapes and lemon enticingly streaks the nose. These flavors continue on a feather-light and dry palate where fresh acidity makes them shine even brighter. This wine is all about expressing the most delicious, dry but totally aromatic lightness. Refreshing and made for summer, it has an irresistible lemon finish."
"Juicy and generous on the palate, this coastal wine is grown from Wente-clone grapes influenced greatly by their cool, foggy environment, showing a tightness of tension and acidity on the palate. Lemon peel and caramelized oak provide elegance and richness in equal measure."
"This is the second wine from this prestigious Saint-Estphe estate. It is just showing maturity as its sheds the tannic shell typical of the vintage and offers secondary, beautifully ripe flavors that retain their structure and fine acidity. There is a leather and spice character that finishes the wine in great style. Drink now."
"A full 13 years old, the aromas are still vibrant, with notes of cranberry sauce, leather, vanilla and baking spice. The palate displays a beautiful sense of balance between the fruit and barrel flavors. It's in an absolute sweet spot right now but still has life in front of it."
"This wine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. High-toned aromas of raspberry, cherry, cranberry, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to concentrated, well-balanced red- and black-fruit flavors. The finish sails into the distance. It drinks beautifully now, but should have a long life in front of it."
"From the heart of the Laguna de Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate delights in rhubarb and strawberry, hugely pleasing in fresh fruitiness. Complexity builds in its salty undertones and bright, sharp teases of blood orange and lemon, while the backbone is strong in floral-driven minerality."
"Stone, earth and pear show on the nose. The palate joins with a bittersweet notion that recalls dried pear skin and dried orange rind. The body remains light, but flavors are anchored deeply and earthily. Made in a very balanced late-harvest style, it has an off-dry finish that will be dreamy with salty cheese."
"It's fading a bit at the rim, but it's a treat to know that mature releases like this are in the market. Age has mellowed its tannins to silky smoothness, while the aromas and flavors resemble thyme blossoms, cherries and leather. Hints of herbal tea and mocha linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now2022."
"From the eastern side of the Napa Valley, this combines 84% Grenache with 16% Mourvdre, harvesting the best clusters of the grapes specifically for this light, dry wine. The juice is left to ferment and rest in concrete egg and neutral French oak. Light-copper in color, it's perfumed in jasmine, with accents of white peach, lime and strawberry, light and ethereal with a backbone of focused acidity."
"Fermented 40% whole cluster and aged in four-year-old 500L puncheons, bright aromas of fresh asparagus, herb, flower, ember and earth are followed by a blend of fruit and savory flavors. It provides an appealing texture that keeps the interest high."

"Hints of ripe Mirabelle and yellow apple show on the rather restrained nose. The palate adds bright, lemony freshness and zesty, pleasantly bitter citrus pith to the fruit, creating a texture alive with juiciness and shot throught with freshness. It leaves a lasting, lemony aftertaste."
"Almost crystal-clear in the glass, this bottling shows broad aromas of red apple and peach before the grass, wet hay, squeezed lime and rainy sidewalk aromas stand up. There is a sharp texture and tension to the sip, where the warmth of poached pear is cut by mowed lawn and wet river stones."
"This winethe only of its kind in the stateis a blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Grenache. It brings appealing, quite pure aromas of herbs, bramble and red fruit. The flavors also bring a compelling sense of purity, with no new oak influence anywhere in sight. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine."
"From 20-year-old vines, this bottling shows strong cedar, crushed graphite and charred wood on the nose, with a hint of blackened pasilla chile. Pencil shavings play strong on the palate, spicing up the elderberry and black-currant fruit, with pinches of oregano adding depth. The tightly wound tannins are quite sticky."
"Concentrated fruit, spice and black-tea flavors lend a sense of depth on the palate and make this full-bodied wine satisfying to sip. Made from the estate vineyard using only Clone 777 vines, it matches black cherry and tart cherry notes to a nicely gripping texture, with a lingering finish."
"Tasty but mild cherry and cinnamon flavors framed in a smooth texture make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. Hints of cranberry and clove add complexity, while a good structure of mild acidity and fine tannins add a little grip on the palate."
"Blackberry toast and dark, sultry pencil shavings are nuanced in additional flavors of clove in this thick, densely built wine that presents as full bodied but finds its balance in the glass. A richness of chocolate and graham cracker rule the finish."
"This dense and generous red opens with notes of sweet smoke, violet, lavender and laurel that complement the blackberry, cassis and cherry core. It's concentrated and robustly fruited, with a smooth texture and round mouthfeel that's framed by spicy tones and velvety tannins that linger through the finish."
"A dusty, sunbaked note in the aroma of this full-bodied wine meets robust and ripe fruit, wood smoke and very concentrated clove, black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors. The color is dark and deep, tannins are very firm, and the mouthfeel is somewhat astringent. This wine needs time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2022."
"This is a strong showing for this growing region south of San Jose, which was historically home to prominent vineyards. Crushed black peppercorns, thyme and rosemary show on the nose against tart blackberry juice, with cola and a touch of blackened beef. Black currant and elderberry arise on the sip along with white-pepper spice, held together by balanced acidity and tannins. It's ripe, but far from overdone."
"A restarined but fresh note of pure lemon rises from the glass. The palate is just as fresh and adds an earthy, stony touch as well as the fruit and texture of russet pear. This is slender and refreshing, yet full of flavor. The finish is lip-smackingly lemony."
"This wine is a blend Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (31%) and Syrah. The aromas open up with vibrant notes of cranberry, cherry, baking spice, licorice, vanilla and barrel spice. The palate is concentrated with cherry and blackberry flavors that show a lot of textural appeal. The tannins bring a touch of grit."

"The second wine from this estate with its moated medieval castle is finely structured while showing all the delicious fruit of this vintage. It has spice, some firm tannins and juicy black-currant fruitiness. It will develop well and relatively quickly. Drink from 2020."
"The slightest touch of creamy vanilla shows on the nose. The palate has a similar, inviting creaminess combined with crisp but friendly lemon freshness. A rounded nuttiness adds interest to this beautifully curvy but toned wine."
"This clonal study explores the earthy side of the grape, with mulberry and dark cranberry fruit running alongside damp oak forest and slightly funky chaparral aromas. Lively flavors consume the palate quickly with tart cherry and peppery spice, all lifted by mouthwatering acidity."
"This refreshing and crisply designed Viognier conveys restrained aromas of white peach and vanilla. The palate shows yellow melon and creamy peach, but with a razor-sharp edge of acidity and a compelling chalky texture. The acid sizzles into the finish."
"Cherries, cinnamon and clove mark the nose, while the flavors include cherries, Mexican chocolate and floral notes. This is full bodied and robust without being hard, easing into a long, velvety-textured finish. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah from 2018 through 2025."
"Aged in 100% new French oak, aromas of roasted coffee bean, herb, char and dark fruit give way to lightly grainy dark-fruit flavors. The wood seems a bit primary at present but it still brings a lot of appeal. Give it some time to integrate."
"This coastal wine hails from two sites, including the Gloria Vineyard in Sebastopol, and Hummingbird Hill in the Petaluma Gap. It stays true to form in its light approach and high-toned acidity. Earthy, light in color and bristling in black tea, cranberry and pomegranate, it's lightly spiced in cardamom."

"This rich wine, produced from old vines, is dense and concentrated. It does have the fruitiness of the vintage but that is allied to the dark-black fruit and powerful tannins. There are spice and wood flavors still developing. Drink this fine wine from 2020."
"A biodynamic red blend, this opens with focused red-cherry and -plum tones that are dusted with hints of cola spice and vanilla. The smooth palate offers plush berry flavors that are framed by structured tannins. Hints of pressed iris and bittersweet chocolate grace the lingering finish."
"Owned by ngociant firm Antoine Moueix, this property on the plateau of Saint-Emilion, has produced a ripe and balanced vintage in 2014. The oak aging has enhanced the richness of the wine with its balanced tannins and black-currant fruits. It will age well and be ready to drink from 2021."
"A blend of Loess Vineyard and Leonetti Old Block, this wine is 100% varietal. The aromas are bright and pure, with notes of raspberry, cherry, plum, anise and spice. The flavors deliver, with a sense of understated appeal."
"The cave cooperative in Tavel is the largest producer in the appellation, so it's reassuring that so many of its cuves scored highly in this year's tastings. Cinnamon and clove notes accent vibrant red berries and citrus in this medium- to full-bodied wine that's long, intense and crisp on the finish."
"Ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum make for a friendly, inviting opening. Lemony freshness persists on the palate where it is joined by spicy white pepper and a savory, salty undertone of yeast. This is refreshing, light and moreish."
"Considered warm by Central Coast standards, Paso Robles is not always ideal for Chardonnay, but the veteran squad at Castoro did well on this nicely tight bottling.

The palate's powerful texture and sizzling acidity carry riper flavors of Gala apple and Anjou pear that continue deep into the finish."
"Savory notes of chervil combine with fresh citrus and ripe pear on the nose. The plate still has a yeasty, leesy touch and a full texture on the generous but fresh body. Slight spritz adds to the verve. The finish is both warming and refreshing, and chock full of pear fruit."
"The inaugural release of this wine is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, coming from Summit View, Pepper Bridge, Cockburn, McClellan Estate, Stone Valley, Seven Hills, Waliser Rocks and Fire Ridge vineyards. Green herb, black fruit, coffee and anise aromas give way to beautifully balanced red- and black-fruit flavors. The acidity brings a sense of vibrancy, while the tannins provide plenty of structure."

"Honeysuckle, wet cement and ripe nectarine show on the tightly wound and bright nose of this bottling from a winery near the Pozo Saloon in southeastern Paso. A ripping acidity starts off the sip, where bright lime blossoms, honeydew rind and light lemongrass flavors make for a very tasty wine."
"One of the few sparkling Syrahs available anywhere in America, this is a very tasty and vibrant wine. Aromas of blackberry, pepper, chipped slate, soil and herbs show on the frothy nose.

"A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak. It offers well-defined flavors of salty leather, plum and dark chocolate."
"From the Fairbarn Vineyard, this bottling shows fresh-pressed blackberry, violet and lilac aromas, with the slightest wafts of smoke and tar. Although the tannins are quite firm on the sip, this wine is still young and should age well, allowing the bright acidity to continue showing flavors of beef and tart berries in years to come."
"Still with intense tannins, this Merlot-dominated blend is young. The fruitiness is all there with ripe smoky fruit and blackberry flavors. It just needs a while for the tannins to soften into ripe generous fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
"Made by the same team as neighboring Chteau Chasse-Spleen, the wine from this 17-acre estate is fruity, with the potential for a smooth texture and rich fruit. The wine has spice, juicy black currants and a delicious aftertaste. Drink from 2021."
"In 1999, Stphane and Paola Gabard resurrected winemaking at an estate that has belonged to the family since the 18th century. Ripe, rich and still retaining its youthful structure, this concentrated wine will need time. With its dense texture and layers of black-currant fruit, it has a fine future. Drink from 2019."
"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 73% of this wine, along with 20% Merlot, 5% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Tightly wound aromas of wood spice, vanilla, black fruit, plum and coffee bean give way to full-bodied, palate-coating and concentrated cherry and espresso flavors that linger on the finish. The barrel influence is heavy, but it works."
"The wine has ripe fruit, tannins that have now softened and signs of maturity. It is still juicy with attractive acidity as well as a touch of spice. Finely balanced, the wine from this Cru Bourgeois estate is elegant and ready to drink."
"A tinge of copper to this white's hue suggests a bit of skin contact, and there's a decided textural element and tannic grip on the palate as well. Pear and melon flavors finish refreshing and mouthwatering in spite of the wine's richness. Drink now."
"One in a series of small cuves from the Right and Left banks, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon (from the great 2010 vintage) is still young. It does have impressively concentrated fruit and powerful tannins to allow it to develop well. Drink this impressive wine from 2019."
"Deep red-cherry aromas meet with crushed slate, wet rocks, wild mint and bay leaf on the complex nose of this bottling by Richard and Thekla Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca. It's soft on the sip, with slightly tart red plum, cranberry and raspberry, lifted by more bay leaf, thyme and dried fennel."
"A touch of flinty reduction colors the nose, showing how young this wine still is. The palate, however, is fresh and sprightly in shape, but totally rich and concentrated in flavor. Svelte generosity shows in the very fluid midpalate texture and a lasting lemon finish."
"This wine is equally split between Merlot and Cabernet Franc (38% each), with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (22%) and Malbec. The aromas are brooding, with notes of barrel spice, coffee, blackberry, green pepper and dried herb. The flavors are bright and fresh, light on their feet, showing a fine sense of elegance and detail."

"Strawberry tea and rose-petal aromas open this wine with nuance and elegance, a nice entry to a velvety texture that's both spicy and sublime. Forest floor and clove contribute complexity as a touch of smoky oak rises on the finish."
"Having spent five years en tirage, this impressive bottling is dry and minerally, with notes of wet stone and white flowers. Light and lively, it offers moderate acidity that allows the wine to build tension and texture on the palate, finishing in green apple."
"The former race-car driver's blend of 49.5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 49.5% Sangiovese and 1% Malbec conveys concentrated dark strawberry and red plum on the nose along with darker fruits, licorice and wet loam aromas. Clove and cinnamon show on the palate, with soft red fruits and cedar, all lifted by a bright acidity."

"A full 13-years-old, the aromas are all tertiary, bringing notes of mushroom, leather and dried cherry. The cranberry and cherry flavors are still holding on the palate, showing a delightful sense of balance. It's in a sweet spot. Drink now."
"A touch of plum plays among the ripe, red-cherry notes of the nose. The palate presents a darker, more brooding aspect of blueberry and forest fruit, with a superfine haze of crunchy tannins. Although the body is slender, crunchy and fresh, it packs an appetizing punch. The finish is refreshing and lip-smacking."
"Sourced from the 3 Starrs Vineyard planted to the Wente clone, this white is lovely. A generous presence of oak and power evolves in the glass to offer a more balanced expression of Gravenstein apple, fig and tangerine. Lengthy, it impresses in its gravelly texture of crushed stone."
"Among top-flight Northern Rhne, this has to be considered a solid value. Hints of melon and gingery spice mark the nose, while the palate is filled out by pear and melon notes. It's full bodied and silky in texture, finishing with echoes of melon and marshmallow. Drink now."
"The aromas bring notes of baking spice, vanilla, cassis, coconut and dark fruit, along with a penetrating anise note. The black-fruit flavors are rich and luscious, displaying a sense of hedonism that shows equal parts fruit and barrel."
"This lovely expression of the grape blends in 21% Smillon, adding a juicy, fleshy texture that's hard to forget. With a cradling of oak, it has a rich body met and balanced by crisp acidity, amid defined flavors of apple skin, melon and pineapple."
"This wine is a blend of 38% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Merlot, and 29% Syrah from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Quintessence and Conner Lee vineyards. Aromas of cigar box, herb, cranberry, smoke, sawdust and pencil lead are followed by rich, ripe red-fruit flavors. It has a lot of appeal."

"Greg Brewer goes for full restraint on this bottling, which offers extremely tight aromas of citrus and wet rocks, only barely revealing that it's a Chardonnay. The flavors are similarly restrained, with lemongrass and guava barely peeking out. Yet the texture is sublime and tightly wound, lifted by a fresh acidity."
"This is a full-bodied, ripe and rich example of Tavel. Flourishes of dried flowers and spices dress up ripe melons and berries, finishing long and warming. It's a ros tailor made for cool end-of-summer evenings."
"Rose, garden berry, botanical herb and new leather aromas emerge on this elegant wine. Savory and smooth, the bright palate presents Marasca cherry, cinnamon, anise and mint while polished tannins frame the lingering finish. It's already accessible but will also age well for the midterm. Enjoy through 2023."
"Airy and creamy aromas of sliced pluot, Asian pear, fresh orange rind and a touch of wet bread make for a compelling and zesty bubbly. The sip starts with a citrusy tang, continues with riper flashes of nectarine on the midpalate and shows a yeasty wash throughout. There's serious textural grip to the palate."

"This wine opens with aromas of green herb, purple fruit, orange peel and wood spice. The palate brings sweet but tart cranberry and cherry flavors that possess a velvety feel. It's an intriguing example of the variety."
"This 11-vineyard blend of 51% Syrah, 31% Grenache, 14% Mourvdre and 4% Counoise represents an excellent value in the realm of expertly balanced but boisterously flavored wines.

"Fern, jasmine, green pear and tart mandarin create an aromatic, inviting nose. The palate supports these aromatics with an intense, concentrated freshness of bright, pure lemon on the midpalate. This is streamlined and refreshing, with just the right amount of invigorating spritz."
"Incredibly dark in the glass, this bottling of a rarely planted but quite fascinating Northern Italian grape show crushed graphite, turned earth, concentrated blueberry and elderberry, and a touch of purple flowers on the brooding nose. Ripe black currants start the sip before waves of powerful acidity, gravelly minerality and peppery spice take hold."
"A blend of fruit from Woodward Canyon and Celilo vineyards, subtle aromas of pear, apple and toast lead to elegant well-balanced fruit flavors, brightened by tart acidity. The balance is exquisite. Apple flavors persist on the finish."

"Alvear is one of Spain's most consistent producers of sweet wines. This vintage Pedro Ximnez is big but fresh on the nose, with apricot and caramel aromas and some heat. A creamy, thick palate is a bit syrupy, while buttered toffee flavors are rich on a highly viscous finish."
"This wine opens with brooding aromas of green olives, capers and smoked meat, along with an herbal lift. The flavors show concentration and richness, mixing fruit, herb and savory flavors in equal parts. It finishes a tad warm."

"Briny like lime salt, this coastal wine is lovely in stony mineral and tart oak. Medium bodied and moderate in acidity, it refreshes in a context of refinement and grace."
"The shy nose gives away a flinty hint of reduction. The palate has a juicier, easier quality where green pear, slightly earthy yeast and fresh citrus are drawn together. The body is light, fresh and very invigorating. With a little air, more aromas awake and present notions of Conference pear and yeasty saltiness."
"The wine is ripe and packed with fruity Merlot. It has a dense structure and an opulent character that gives the wine considerable richness. The firm tannins are cushioned by all this fruit. It does have high alcohol, but the final acidity ensures that the wine remains crisp."
"Black fruits dominate this second wine of Kirwan, an 1855 Third Growth Grand Cru Class. The oak aging is subtle and gives a smooth character rather than strong toasty flavors. The richness and structure do promise some aging although this wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2020."
"From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuve shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose. Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish."
"Cabernet Sauvignon (57%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Petit Verdot (18%), Merlot (17%), Cabernet Franc (7%) and Malbec. Bright aromas of plum, cranberry, cigar box, blackberry, caf au lait and smoke lead to sweet generous red and black-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of purity of flavor that captures the attention."
"From 100% estate-grown Calistoga fruit, this tiny-production wine is well-composed in compost, grilled mushroom and meaty undertones, the sturdy structure and ripe body robust and integrated. Cinnamon and clove dot the lengthy finish. This wine will benefit from more time in bottle; drink best 20192024."
"A mix of earthy berry, cassis and leather aromas sets up a grabby, rubbery palate that isn't very lush or cushioned. Flavors of roast plum, savory spice, olive and tobacco are more earthy than ripe, staying steady on a savory, roasted-tasting finish. Drink through 2022."
"Richly oaked aromas of maple and mocha accent earthy, rubbery berry scents. This is muscled-up and edgy on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, mocha, plum and berry fruits. A grabby, slightly collapsed finish contains earthy, savory flavor remnants. Drink through 2020."
"Full bodied and gritty in texture, this wine smooths out in the glass, opening to slowly unravel layers of forest pine, black cherry and cola. With measured oak, it has a depth and breadth across the palate, revealing concentration within a graceful context."
"Blue-fruit aromas are front and center along with notes of herb and barrel spice. The palate shows restraint and suppleness that continues through the sweet fruit flavors on the finish. It's an intriguing, stylistically unique offering of this variety."
"Merlot makes up 58% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Cabernet Franc. A blend of fruit from Anna Marie, Spring Valley, Loess, and Minnick Hills vineyards, the aromas are light, with notes of plum, raspberry, barrel toast and spice. The palate is soft and silky, gliding on the finish. It's all about delicacy."
"From the mighty site, this is aged in both French and American oak, half of it new. Rich, robust layers of Dr Pepper, vanilla and chocolate rise on the smoothly textured palate, impressing in power and density."
"This elegant wine, one of very few brands from Humboldt County, strikes a good balance between a ripe, delicious fruit character and moderately spicy, buttery themes, without the influence of oak. Good, tangy acidity supports the flavors of vanilla, Anjou pear, and marzipan that come out first in the aroma and then spread to the palate."
"Slight reduction on the nose only adds to the appeal of fresh lemon and juicy pear. On the palate, the fruit attains zesty definition and phenolic grip. This is concentrated, brisk and bright, with an earthy counterpart that seems grounding and balancing. The freshness of the concentrated midpalate rings through to the long, clean and still-brisk finish."
"This opens with aromas of rose petals and cake spices. The bright, already accessible palate offers red cherries, crushed raspberries, white pepper and tobacco set against polished tannins. Drink through 2022."
"Tender notes of ripe Mirabelle plum play on the nose alongside an earthier element. The palate becomes fuller and fruitier, expressing more of that juicy Mirabelle on its lemon-toned and streamlined body with a zesty texture. The finish is lip-smacking and bright, echoing with lemony fruit."
"A terrific value in Syrah from the Northern Rhne, the 2014 La Champine offers notes of violets, raspberries and cracked peppercorns on the nose. It's silky and medium-bodied in the mouth, with red-fruit flavors alongside hints of thyme and sage. The finish is long and mouthwatering. Drink now2025."
"Lemon and pineapple aromas start this full-bodied but friendly pour from the Peloponnese. Citrus, sea salt and a mineral finish give the wine elegance and a versatile food character."
"This shows a touch of evolution in its faded rim, but the aromas of cherries, cinnamon and mocha remain pristine. The tannins are smooth and supple, subtly framing expressive flavors of cherries, chocolate, espresso and baking spices. Drink now2022."
"Very spicy and mineral-like in aroma and flavor, this new Mendocino release from a Napa-based winery is unusual in the intensity of salty, nutty components that dominate the crisp grapefruit and green-apple flavors underneath. Concentrated in flavor, tight and dense in texture, it will need time to reach its peak, and will be best after 2020."
"This wine is 100% Cabernet, coming from Seven Hills, Loess, Summit View, Yellow Jacket, Stone Valley, Ferguson and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Locked-up aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb, vanilla and dark fruit give way to rich but well balanced black-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins offer sufficient support."
"This blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 20% Cinsault shows the same attention to quality as the Domaine's other bottlings. Ripe red berries, dried spices and crushed stone all mingle easily on the bright nose and round palate, finishing long and intense. Drink now."
"A riper touch of russet-pear peel joins the fresh lemon notes on the nose. On the palate, zesty concentration becomes evident. This is compact and has impact but retains a juicy, friendly core that makes you want to sip more. Lemon ripeness continues through the long, dry finish."
"The aromas are quite pure, with notes of black cherry, anise and blackberry. The palate is more restrained than the aromas might suggest, with plentiful but elegant dark-fruit flavors that persist through the finish."
"Exhibiting Sebastopol Hills' signature brightness and crunch, this light, crisply rendered wine is a showcase for funky cranberry, black tea and a surprising hit of white pepper. The floral aromatics shine within a cerebral backdrop of crafty winemaking."
"High-toned aromas of cocoa, toast, mixed green herb and dark fruit lead to tart cherry and cranberry flavors that bring a pucker factor. It shows a very lovely sense of balance that keeps the interest high. Give it some additional time in bottle or a short decant."
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (58%), Cabernet Franc (22%), Cabernet Sauvignon (15%) and Petit Verdot. Brooding aromas of cherry, blackberry, wood spice, anise and bittersweet chocolate lead to dry, incredibly tightly wound tannins. It needs significant time in the cellar to soften a bit. Don't go near it until 2025 unless you give it an extended decant."
"The aromas are light initially, with notes of cocoa, herb, barrel spice and cherry not yet fully ready to reveal their charms. The cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors are backed by lightly grainy tannins that need some time to unwind. The wood is intense at present but there are good things underneath."
"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price."
"Dark strawberry, rust, tar and sandalwood show on the nose of this bottling, which is still in its infancy despite already being six years old. Bright and booming acidity slices through the sour cherry, cranberry, cedar and pine-resin flavors, framed by tense but not overwhelming tannins. Drink 20192031."
"Aromatic ripe, red cherries reveal a tart touch of redcurrant on the nose. The palate has that same appetizing, red-fruited allure: refreshing and juicy, but never heavy. A fresh-faced and authentic red, it has been captured at the perfect intersection of ripeness and crunch. It can even be served a little chilled."
"Enticing scents of red berry, crushed rose petal and wild herb take center stage. Round and savory, the palate offers juicy black cherry, licorice and tobacco framed in polished tannins and fresh acidity. It won't need years to come around but it will also stand up to midterm aging. Drink 20192028."
"This winery has been making ros for more than two decades, and nails the recipe especially well this vintage. The brilliant salmon-pink wine shows watermelon, light red cherry and a stony quality on the nose, while the grippy palate engages from the get-go with red plum, riverstone and gravel on the tip of the sip. Strawberry flavors carry through the strong acidity, and the finish is all about texture."
"This light-bodied wine is intriguing in its shocks of white pepper, rose-petal aroma and dark-cherry flavor. Well balanced and fresh, it shows a bite of sizable tannin midpalate that softens and is tamed on the finish."
Beautiful black-cherry aromas and flavors make this wine direct and focused. A slightly gripping texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity keeps the mouthfeel lively. It has a wonderful sense of purity and focus.
"Perfumed in rose, this wine from the higher elevations of the appellation is a study in understated freshness and stony mineral, offering too a thickness of cassis. Big oak asserts itself on the finish, with a streak of tart citrus adding to the intrigue."
"A full six-years-old, this is a quality example of this extremely cool vintage. A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, the aromas are vibrant but seem ever so slightly dried out, with notes of anise, cassis and blackberry. The red and black-fruit flavors display a fine sense of balance and length that keeps the interest high."
"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish."
"Subtle and somewhat sweet aromas of honey, candied pecan, fresh-sliced honeydew and lemon balm show on the nose of this bottling by Greg Brewer from a brand new vineyard. The palate is clean and fresh, and the sip offers a great tactile sensation on the tongue, with grippy tannins revealing citrus and melon flavors."
"Fresh plum, tomato and spice aromas are integrated. On the palate, this wine is ripe and saturated but not heavy. Generous flavors of caramel, vanilla, plum and berry fruits are smooth and chocolaty across the finish. Drink now through 2020."
"Made with equal parts Lagrein, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah, this offers aromas of black currant, ground pepper and a whiff of graphite. The firm palate delivers ripe black plum, roasted coffee bean and allspice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2022."
"A velvety texture and extremely concentrated black-fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine delicious to savor. It has beautiful big tannins that are well integrated, luxurious blackberry, sage and cedar flavors, plus great length on the finish."
"Aromas of barrel spice, purple fruit and herb lead to well-balanced fruit and barrel flavors. It's an unusual interpretation of Cabernet. Still, it should have a long life in front of it, showing a lot of structure."
"The second wine of Chteau Glana in the prestigious Saint-Julien appellation is properly tannic with fruit in the background. The wine will develop well, but will still require some time. Its juicy black-currant fruitiness and acidity have power and concentrationenough to produce a ripe, while still elegant wine from 2020."
"Here's a new wood-aged young wine, with ripe fruit and mint aromas. The wine does have a bitter edge of extraction that detracts from the generous black fruitiness. It is certainly firm at this stagea full-bodied wine with a dark-fruit character at the end. Drink from 2020."
"For what is essentially a second wine, generally blended from the estate's younger vines, this is a solid effort in a not-so-easy vintage. Vanilla and cinnamon from barrel-aging play a role hedre, but there's also plenty of juicy, plum-tinged fruit. There's ample body and texture, capped off by supple tannins and a lingering finish. Drink now2022."
"The wine comes from a tiny seven-acre estate to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Owned by the same family since 1847, it estate is making serious wine. This is a rich wine, perfumed by Cabernet Franc although firmly based in Merlot. Black plum and berries are strengthened by the firm tannins that will allow further aging. Drink from 2018."
"A touch of flinty reduction still hovers abovde enticing savory and herbal notes of chervil, yeast and white pepper. These are given direction and drive on the spritzy, lively palate by brisk, crisp and fresh acidity. This unusual pairing of Grner Veltliner and Riesling unites the savory and invigorating nature of both grapes to create liveliness. It's intersting and irresistible."
"An aromatic nose combines jasmine and white blossom with creamy tangerine and citrus notes. The palate still has a touch of yeastiness, a lovely textural element and a dry, brisk freshness. It provides a charming combination of whistle-clean citrus notes on a very slender body."
"A blend of three-quarters Malbec and one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon, berry aromas are up front, along with notes of raspberry torte, dark chocolate and spice. The palate is flavorful and supremely smooth, sweetening on the warm and lingering finish. It offers a hedonistic sense of appeal."
"A focused line of lemon balm meets with gardenia, soft jasmine, light butterscotch and green tea on the nose of this county blend by Colombian-born, French-trained Winemaker Bibiana Gonzlez Rave. Lemon, light vanilla and a touch of warm pastry show on the palate."
"The approachable nose of this wine shows baked blackberry pie in vanilla crust, with touches of dried purple flowers. The palate is similarly crowd-pleasing, with dark berry and baking spice flavors given intriguing depth through hints of game and rosemary."
"This mouthfilling wine is generously ripe and rich, with hints of herb and mountain brush dancing around soft, rounded layers of plum and cinnamon. The finish is lush and lingering."
"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice. All Clone 95, the tropical-fruit flavors are sweet, rich and layered. A touch of heat on the finish is the only thing that holds it back."
"Exotic spice, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and French oak aromas lift out of the glass. The palate shows toasted oak, coconut, espresso raspberry and cherry alongside tight close-grained tannins that grip the austere finish. It's still on its oak so give it time to come around. Drink after 2023."
"Although the nose is restrained, fresh, ripe notions of Mirabelle and yellow apple can be made out. The palate is bright and poised, shot through with lemon zestiness and lip-smacking freshness. Dry, toned and slender, it's packed with bright, citrusy fruit."
"Almost confected, candied notions of red berry appear on the nose. The palate tones these down and comes in with a smooth, rounded and ripe body. Alcoholic power becomes evident on the finish, as does a fine-meshed tannic structure. This is a plush but elegant Pinot Noir with just a little spice."
"This off-the-wall blend of 55% Zinfandel, 37% Barbera and 8% Shiraz works quite well, with aromas of pressed elderberries, crushed violets and dark chocolate. The sip starts off juicy, fresh and approachable for many palates, showing cooked black plum, more tart plum skin and salt and pepper spices."
"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from The Benches, Dionysus and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Aromas of cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, blackberry and French-oak spice rise up from the glass. The palate brings rich, velvety dark fruit flavors backed by fine-grained tannins. It needs some time to fully settle in. Best after 2021."
"This is rich, honeyed and ripe on the nose and full-bodied and round in the mouth, with just enough acidity to provide backbone and length. The peach, melon and citrus notes linger on the mouthwatering finish."
"This is a lovely and well-balanced display of unoaked Chardonnay, with all of the flowery frills yet none of the treacly, overly tropical touches. Light in the glass, it shows guava, jasmine water and a lime-skin tartness. The palate is amazingly fresh, with guava, papaya, peach and ripe pear flavors that persist deep into the finish."
"The aromas are light, with notes of garden herb, pencil lead, barrel spice and dark fruit that are not yet ready to fully reveal their potential. The palate brings considerably more generosity, with lithe black-fruit flavors backed by fine-grained tannins. It's a very pretty expression of the variety."
"Moss and citrus join the Conference-pear flavors on the nose. The palate tingles with citrus freshness and has edges of white pepper, savory yeast and salty soy. The flavors are mouthfilling but wonderfully light on a zesty, slender and refreshing palate."
"Juicy in smoked cherry and a thick, velvety texture, this luxuriously pretty wine blends several estate blocks and clones. Forest floor, cola, clove, pine and black cherry highlight an integrated approach. It stays balanced and complex through a lengthy finish that further accentuates the spice."
"The nose is very shy, giving little away apart from slight citrus. Everything happens on the palate, with tender but ripe pear fruit gently edged with zesty citrus. A tingle of white pepper along the lemon peel creates a vividly fresh but light wine. It's clean and totally refreshing, with a long finish."
"Lemon and lime are just hinted at on the restrained nose. On the palate they are joined by friendly, juicy stone-fruit notes of ripe yellow Mirabelle plum. The palate is dry, light and juicy, with a delicate stature that leads to a zesty citrus finish."
"A blend of 74% Syrah, 10% Carignan, 6% Grenache, 6% Mourvdre and 4% Cinsault, this is an elegant and harmonious wine. It showcases a masterful balance between lush, ripe black berry fruits and earthy, toasty spice. With its crushed-velvet texture, bold fruit flavors and lingering spice accents, the wine is easy to appreciate and enjoy now, yet structured enough to age well for another 610 years."

"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (23%), Cabernet Franc (13%), Malbec (6%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herb, flower, pencil lead, cherry jam and spice lead to light tart, fresh fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance."
"Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity. Chalky texture is highlighted in tart mountain cherry, graphite and vanilla laced in clove. Enjoy best 20232033."
"This wine is sourced from multiple sites across the appellation, including Rochioli, Mill Station and Laughlin Road, all of the vineyards relatively cool. Light and mineral-driven, the wine presents as crisp and subtle in oak, allowing for exotic fruit and floral elements to show and a richness to develop slowly toward the finish."
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically expressive, with notes of raspberry, cigar box, mint, caf au lait, blackberry, dried herb, anise and wet gravel. The palate displays a sense of elegance and refinement that captures the attention, with red-fruit flavors lingering on the long (slightly warm) finish."
"This is a single vineyard, 100% varietal wine, aged in 70% new French oak. It draws you into the glass, with notes of char, fig, blackberry, spice and coffee. The dark-roasted coffee and dark-fruit flavors show precision and detail, lingering on the finish. The wood is primary at present but should integrate with time."
"Light and spicy, this wine surprises and delights. It shows a tannic underbrush of firmness and grit that's seasoned in tart acidity and flavors of rhubarb, currant and black tea. It's well balanced and enjoyable now."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Boushey, Bacchus, The Benches and Candy Mountain vineyards. Very primary aromas of smoke, toast, char and cherry are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors. The oak seems a little heavy handed at times but it still brings a lot of appeal."
"Earthy aromas of olive, tobacco, prune and oak set up a palate with drawing tannins. This tastes of coffee, mocha and earthy mixed berries. The finish is meaty in texture, with compatible oak spice and berry-fruit notes."
"The merest touch of peach and Golden Delicious apple plays on the nose. The palate features lively lemon notes on a very slender, brisk and fresh palate, along with a tiny bit of spritz. It shows a depth of fruit: a wine for lovers of subtlety. The crisp apple-peel finish is totally moreish."
"High-toned aromas of blackberry, aniseed, macerated cranberry, motor oil and flower lead to rich full-bodied cranberry and blackberry flavors that bring a sense of hedonism."
"Fruity hints of blueberry pie on the nose are juicy, ripe and enticing. The palate has the same generous fruit, joined by forest elements. It's a fruit-driven, juicy and ripe wine with a fresh counterpoint, a slight grip and a spicy finish."
"Smooth, silky and ready to drink, this medium- to full-bodied wine is a fine choice to go with nearly any red-meat dish. Hints of smoke and herb dress up the dark berry flavors, finishing with mouthwatering acidity."
"Floral and fleshy, this is a big-boned, concentrated wine. A ripe rendering of apple, pear and peach is spiked in intriguing seasonings of lemongrass and nutmeg."

"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured."
"Both tropical and herbal notes join the citrus flavors on the nose, hinting of passion fruit as well as mint. The palate tones this down and puts ripe lemon in the spotlight. Sleek and slender, the body has a creamy element of yeast but is dry and brisk. The finish is very balanced and lasting."
"Ripe citrus notes appear immediately, recalling Amalfi lemon with rounder notions of tangerine and mandarine. The palate slims down to a light-footed, slender core of juicy, friendly and invigorating freshness. Streamlined and lemony, it evokes a citrusy brightness that seems almost cleansing."

"Full-bodied and richly textured, this is a powerful Hermitage worthy of the cellar. Roasted or grilled sweet corn, peach and melon notes fill out the palate, while intense pineapple flavors persist on the long finish. Drink now, or 20252030."
"Velvety, with a touch of grit, this wine is tart and tangy in acidity, with a firmness of structure and tannin. The boldly interwoven flavors are defined by wild strawberry, cranberry and black tea."
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%), and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of scorched earth, barrel spice, wood and dark fruit lead to a bold dark-fruited palate backed by firm tannins. It displays plenty of breadth and brawn, with the oak primary now but likely to integrate over time."
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors match well with the full body and ripe cherry and berry notes, giving a broad, mouthcoating texture and sense of warmth. Winemaker Elizabeth Grant-Douglas aged the wine in French oak barrels, 30% new."
"The nose gives little away except for a touch of reductive smoke. The palate then presents a streak of zesty freshness, a light ripple of lovely texture and shimmering nuances of white pepper, crushed chervil, salty soy and savory miso. All this comes on a very light body, finishing with a bright, friendly note of lemon."

"Broad aromas of cranberry and pomegranate are dusted with dried sage, tea and forest woods in this single-vineyard expression. The sagebrush and woody spice flavors show strongly on the sip, giving depth to the pomegranate and hibiscus notes. Quite dry and tangy, this should age well."
"A mere suspicion of black cherry can be discerned on the nose of this Zweigelt-Pinot Noir blend. On the palate, ripe but tart cherry fruit is on full display, made precise by ample freshness. It conveys a touch of white pepper amid soft, pliable tannins, with an edge of crunchy freshness."

"Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc (38%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Petit Verdot and Malbec. The aromas are all high toned and somewhat locked up, with notes of herb, dried flower, chocolate and cherry. The palate offers a sense of sophistication and restraint, showing a lot of polish."
"Subdued aromas of moist soil, funk, ember and smoke are followed by supersmooth cranberry, cherry and savory flavors, along with abundant earth accents. It brings an appealing sense of texture, although it's quite reserved in style for a Rocks wine."

"Lighter in color, the aromas from this Rocks District wine are delicate, with notes of raspberry, kirsch, herb, rose petal and smoke. The flavors meanwhile are plump and generous, bringing a real sense of purity and restraint due to the neutral French oak aging. The extended finish shows a touch of warmth."

"Fresh notes of ripe red and black cherry abound on nose and palate. This wine is juicy and bright, drawing on ample fruit that dances on the palate. The tannins are fine and have only the slightest grip, giving backbone to all this exuberance. Freshness brightens the flavors and gives tension to the sleek body. This juicy, utterly cherry-ish red will also work slightly chilled."
"Rich and layered, this impressive wine is memorable in its full grasp of cherry grenadine and cola, the succulent flavors spiked in spicy clove. On the lengthy finish, it takes on a blueberry note that's welcome in its balance of sweet and sour."
"This wine all comes from Watermill Vineyard down in the Rocks District. Seeing only 27% new French oak, it rises up from the glass with appealing aromas of orange peel, moist earth, ember, herb and smoked meat, along with wisps of black olive. The palate is supersmooth and silky, showing a beguiling sense of texture. The concentration seems a bit light at times, but overall it delivers."
"The wine, from one of the five Aubert family properties, is rich and full of great fruit. With ripe tannins and blackberry generosity over the wood aging, this is still structured yet ready to drink."
"The cave cooperative in Tavel is hitting on all cylinders, turning out numerous consistent, top-rated examples. Diffrent doesn't have the spicy nuances of the very best Tavels, but it offers a bold, ripe mouthful of raspberry and cherry fruit, ample weight and richness and a long, slightly dusty-textured finish. Drink now2018."
"Iris, dark-skinned berry, aromatic herb and new leather aromas take shape in the glass. Vibrant and focused, the bright palate doles out crushed raspberry, Marasca cherry, clove and white pepper framed in tightly knit but polished tannins. It's well balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 20202028."
"Wet moss, green apple and russet-pear peel create a nose that is spicy, fresh and fruity. The palate concentrates these flavors against a backdrop of zesty citrus freshness. Compact and taut, the body is accentuated by slight spritz, and is very appealing in its zesty vigor."
"This blend of 83% Albario and 17% Grenache Blanc is slightly incongruous from the juicy nose to the tight sip, but it works. Sunny aromas of honey, peach and white flowers hint at a sweeter wine, but the palate is tight, bright and bone dry, showing orange mousse, Key lime and grassy flavors."
"A full mish-mash of white Rhne varieties (the largest single component is Grenache Blanc, at 30%), this is a full-bodied, rich white. One-fourth of it is barrel fermented, which adds a clove element to the apricot and melon fruit. Drink it by the end of 2018."
"Given that this is where Santa Barbara County's first Syrah was planted, it's no wonder that Zaca Mesa makes well-balanced expressions of the grape with stunning consistency. This bottling shows blackberry, black pepper, cola and purple flowers on the nose, leading into a tightly structured palate packed with tart black-plum skins, beef char and more black-pepper dust."
Aromas of blackberry jam and boysenberry lead to a ripe full-bodied palate. It brings a sense of hedonism.

Pure red- and blue-fruit aromas are followed by bold fruit flavors and well-integrated tannins, without a trace of oak in sight. It's a completely unique interpretation of the variety, but most importantly, it's delicious."
"Cherry and strawberry aromas lead this beautifully hued, complex rose'. The palate offers layers of herbal, blackberry and strawberry, with a brisk minerality and spicy finish adding dimension."
"This blend of Roditis and Viognier starts with aromas of fresh lemon blossom, sea salt and jasmine, leading into a nimble and delicate array of citrus and spice on the palate. Clean and focused but with a curvaceous edge."
"Clean and crisp lines of sea salt and lemon zest meet with caramelized white peach and pear on the nose of this bottling from the Foley family. The palate's chalky texture delivers richer flavors of baked yellow pears, cinnamon and baking spice."
"Lifted notes of ripe Amalfi lemon zest play on the nose. The palate has the same fresh but fruity and approachable friendliness. Slender and compact, the dry body has an appealing juiciness that delivers total lemon refreshment."
"Made by David Ramey, this blend of 80% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante and 9% Petite Sirah impresses in its fruit-forward approachability and all-around likability. Earthy, it teases in dark cherry, vanilla and milk-chocolate flavors, the texture smoothly etched in fine leather."
"An elegant blend of Pinot Nero and Nerello Mascalese, this bright sparkler offers enticing scents of strawberry, raspberry and a whiff of pastry cream that carry over to the vibrant palate along with a hint of Mediterranean herb. It's persistent and refreshing, with a refined perlage."
"Pale peach in color, the aromas bring bright notes of passion fruit, guava and strawberry. It drinks dry, but with plenty of kiwi and other tropical-fruit flavors bringing a sense of sweetness. Distinctly fruit forward for a ros, it delivers a lot of appeal, despite occasionally seeming a bit weighty."
"This is the first Chenin Blanc from this up-and-coming winery. All native yeast fermented and aged in stainless steel, the aromas pop, with notes of pear, apple, lees and melon. Sleek in style, it brings a sense of brightness and purity of flavor and bright acids. Very varietally correct, it's a compelling example of Chenin in the state. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
"Done in the very dry, herbally infused Santa Cruz Mountains style, this blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 8% Cabernet Franc offers cohesive aromas of black cherry, oregano, gravel and graphite. The mouthfeel is soft but with a tannic tension, showing tart and cedar-laced black plum, elderberry, bittersweet chocolate and tobacco flavors."
"Rounded and approachable, this estate-driven wine is 100% varietal and dusty on the palate in tight-grained oak and tannin. The flavors are richly rewarding, etched in chocolate-covered raspberry, clove and an herbal undercurrent that's hard to pin down."
"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, braised meat, flower and mineral lead to a full-bodied palate, rich with blue and purple fruit flavors that possess a supple seamless feel and a lengthy finish."
"Candied blueberry and blackberry syrup make for a very fruity and yet quite appealing entry to this bottling from the Bill Foley-owned band. The purple flavors are strong on the sip as well, with grape Jolly Rancher most prominent. Elegance comes from hints of Earl Grey tea and lavender, making the wine both hedonistic and heady."
"An aromatic touch of cinnamon plays on the nose amid crunchy, ripe red cherry. Light and juicy, the palate has a finely woven tannic crunch, making the wine appetizing and toothsome. Combined with the inherent freshness and cherry flavors, this light summer red offers an intriguing edge. It will also work well when slightly chilled."
"Honeysuckle, orange blossoms, lemongrass and the twinge of melon show on the complex but not overly ripe nose of this bottling from the Parker family's estate vineyard. The high-acid palate offers lemon peel and wild-lime flavors that make it the perfect pairing for Thai food."
"Showy aromas of blueberry, black cherry, coffee, chocolate syrup, violets and roasted lamb show on the nose of this bottling, which owner B.J. Fazeli denotes as Shiraz to honor his Persian roots. Flavors of stewed blueberry and black plum meet with dried ginger and caramel on the sip. Drink now."
A no-fuss approach makes this aromatic and smoothly textured wine a treat. The oak influences suggesting tamarind and cedar are subtle and complementary to the good black cherry and black-plum flavors. Supple tannins lend a light bite to the mouthfeel.
"Lighter in color, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The aromas are locked up tightly on first pour, opening up over time to reveal notes of herb, spice, flower and dark cherry. The palate is more giving, with abundant but still elegant cherry and herb flavors that linger on the finish. It's all about elegance."
"Single vineyard Rieslings are a relative rarity in the state. This one brings aromas of lime zest, citrus, white peach and apricot. It drinks off dry, leaning a bit sweeter but with well-balanced acidity along with plentiful peach and orange flavors. Apple notes persist on the finish. The sense of balance is impressive."
"Fans of the popular television show for which this wine is named will cherish its bold approach, combining Cabernet Sauvignon with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Petite Sirah. Chocolate and coffee flesh out the thick, velvety texture, which is similarly robust and inviting in ripe cherry and vanilla flavors."
"An aromatic touch of wet moss and ripe, yellow apple make for an inviting nose. The palate adds a juicy touch of apricot alongside bright, brisk and zesty freshness. The interplay of juicy and sharp works well, making this appetizing and moreish. Juiciness and freshness linger on the finish."
"A hint of cinnamon touches upon ripe, red-cherry notes, creating an appetizing nose. The palate has juicy lightness and ease, edged with white pepper. Light and juicy, it's an excellent, animating party wine."
"This widely available and affordably priced Sauvignon Blanc is light in the glass, disclosing crisp lime, grass, wet cement and white-flower bud aromas. There is tons of sizzle to the palate, where Key and kaffir-lime flavors accent the grass and ripe pear elements."
"This tropical mlange of fruit and blossoms lives up to its equally ebullient packaging. While deft in body, it bounds from the glass with floral perfume and juicy watermelon and cherry flavors. It's zesty and bold yet spry and freshan aptly named accompaniment to summer."
"An aromatic touch of freshly cut grass and nettle hovers above the telltale aromas of Muscat grapes, blossom and citrus. The palate comes in with exquisite lightness, freshness and transparency, carrying refreshing aromatics on a vein of lemon zestiness. The finish adds green apple notes and leaves you wanting more. It's both delicate and aromatic."
"Freshly cut green apple with a touch of lemon signals great refreshment on the nose. The palate has a touch more roundness, giving more flesh to the apple fruit. It still plays a brisk, dry Riesling game, characterized by lemon on a dry, slender palate."
"Seeing only neutral French oak, reserved but intriguing aromas of dark raspberry, herb and plum are followed by well-constructed dark-fruit flavors. It's equal parts intrigue and delivery."
"This latest bottling from the Jackson Family Wines' Seeds of Empowerment fundraising series shows woody, somewhat gamy aromas of animal hide alongside black cherry and sandalwood spice. The gamy quality extends to the sip, where dried meat meets red currant, cherries and a hint of fennel."
"Aromas of yellow stone fruit and chopped Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this fragrant sparkler. The frothy palate doles out juicy yellow peach, mature apricot, thyme and a hint of candied tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity."
"Heavily oaked and charred aromas of saucy berry fruits and espresso lead to a choppy, astringent palate. Reedy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and saucy. It feels tannic and drawing on an oaky finish that sports a clove note. Drink from 20182026."
"This is the second wine of Clos Haut-Peyraguey. It comes from a fine Sauternes vintage with a great balance between acidity and rich sweetness. With botrytis, plenty of sweetness, bitter marmalade and apricot fruit and delicious acidity, the wine is almost ready to drink. Just wait until the end of 2017."
"The blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah mixes notes of black cherries with hints of red raspberries to create a delicious tension. Dried spices and mocha add nuance, while the tannins are firm at first, fading to the texture of cocoa powder on the long finish. Drink now2022."
"The inaugural release from this winery from Sleight of Hand Cellars' production winemaker Keith Johnson is a blend of Mourvdre (90%), Syrah (8%) and Grenache Blanc. Stylistically somewhat unique for Washington, it brings brooding aromas of sauvage, herb, smoked meat and white pepper, along with a bit of reduction. The fruit flavors are pure and bring an appealing sense of texture. Give it time to open up and pair it with food to see it at its best."
"This is a hearty and hedonistic blend of Syrah, Grenache, Viognier and Petit Verdot from one of Monterey's warmer regions. Pure blackberries and black cherries show on the brooding nose, with touches of mint and licorice. The palate is soft on entry, then come boisterous flavors of black currant and blueberry. Nettle, fennel and coffee elements add depth."
"This taut, intense wine is a bit angular compared to many Tavels, but pull out a bottle around Thanksgiving, and it should be singing. Cherry and citrus flavors collide on the palate, but should merge into a seamless whole with a bit of bottle age."
"From a somewhat maligned vintage, this is a commendable effort. It's not as textural as the wine can be in better years, but it shows enough richness to easily carry the attractive leather, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now2025."
"The rich fruit and structure of this impressive wine are already well integrated. With power and concentration as well as layers of dark fruits, it is showing fine aging potential. The wine, dominated by 80% Merlot, comes from vines in the east of Saint-Emilion. Drink from 2020."
"A traditional blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvdre, this is a silky, medium-bodied wine. Cinnamon and cedar shadings frame bright cherry fruit and linger through the elegant finish. Drink now2019."
"Lively acidity wraps itself around fresh notions of grapefruit, gooseberry and peach in this fuller, richer style of white. French oak played a part in both fermentation and aging, adding a luxurious undercurrent of texture and complexity."
"This wine from the Gonfrier family property is full of berry fruits. It's also a ripe wine that is already drinkable. It has generous tannins and balanced acidity that gives the wine its crisp edge as a contrast to the blackberry flavors. Drink now, or even better, wait until 2018."
"This light-bodied wine offers a fruity nose of cherry and raspberry and fresh flavors of strawberry, cherry and a touch of herbs. Balanced but with assertive style, the wine is perfect for spicy cuisine or burgers."
"One of Temecula's pioneering vintners, Phil Baily takes his balanced wines seriously. This bottling shows lots of damp earth, black olive, concentrated mulberry, dried herbs and cardamom on the nose. Stewed black-cherry fruit meshes with Indian spice and well-integrated tannins on the palate that is built for aging."
"Very light in color, this wine brings appealing aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, orange peel, herb, earth and sauvage. The palate is ethereally light and delicate, showing pleasing nuances, with plenty of floral flavors on the finish."
"The nose is shy but a deeper sniff reveals ripe notes of green pear. These also appear on the compact and slender palate, accented by a bright lemon freshness. It's refreshing, clean and bright, and the finish leaves you wanting more."
"Crisp pear skins, kaffir lime, dewy oregano and underripe honeydew show on the nose of this sprightly bottling. The palate reveals a straightforward, slightly restrained Sauv Blanc, with grass, lime, sliced pear, chilled cherimoya and jasmine flavors."
"Made entirely from Grenache, this wine is whole-cluster fermented and aged in stainless steel. It's a dry, light expression that's pretty on the nose and palate, with inviting strawberry notes alongside hints of lemon and orange. It offers refreshing acidity alongside a meaty body and wet-stone minerality."
"Steely and stony in texture and underlying minerality, this medium-bodied effort shows a wealth of floral aromatics, along with lighthearted melon and green apple. A lushness to the finish is welcoming and complex."
"Light pink-orange in color, this is made from 90% Grenache and 10% Cinsault, fermented in both stainless-steel tank and neutral French oak barrels. Floral, lemony and tart, the flavors are defined in jasmine and raspberry, with a lasting thirst-quench of fresh watermelon."
"Earthy and smooth, this is a light, crisply ripe wine. It offers a delicate layering of baked raspberry, citrus and cardamom spice."
"Saucy, gritty aromas of molasses, savory plum and road tar are more dark and brooding than fruity. This blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot is tight and collected on the palate, with gritty, oaky flavors of blackberry and dark plum. A peppery, spicy finish gets much of its taste from the barrel. Drink through 2023."
"Made entirely with Timorasso, this opens with aromas of acacia flower, lemon peel and a whiff of hazelnut. The vibrant palate offers citrus zest, McIntosh apple and a touch of raw almond alongside bright acidity. Drink 2016 through 2022."
"Sourced from Dutton Ranch, this well-priced wine provides a great tasting expression of dark, brooding black cherry and full-bodied density, seasoned in black tea and cardamom for added depth and interest."
"Vintner BJ Fazeli is pushing brand creativity in Temecula with this Embrace the Chaos lineup. This bottling of 71% Cinsaut and 29% Mourvdre is a rusty shade of red. It offers aromas of vanilla, red cherry, red flowers, crushed gravel and nutmeg on the nose. Sanguine flavors of red cherry, white pepper, oregano and blood show on this sip."
"Spritzy and fresh in acidity, this white combines the richness of vanilla cream with the crispness of peach and green apple, finding a middle ground between lush texture and zippy stoniness."
"This richly layered wine is elegant on the entry and generates depths of flavor and texture as it goes. Coffee grounds, black currant and blackberry are wrapped in savory pepper, pencil shavings and tobacco, finishing in an integrated manner."
"Tender, delicate notes of passion fruit can be glimpsed amidst the citrus flavors of the nose. The palate is slender and light, with that same lemony freshness and poise. Drink this fresh, crisp and fruity wine while aromas are at their peak."
Voluptuous aromas of white and yellow peach meet with seared lemon peel and light kisses of oak and nuts on the nose of this bottling by the pioneering brand now owned by Bill Foley. Sea salt and lemon slices mesh with pear and vanilla on the palate.
"A tropical whiff of passion fruit opens proceedings. The palate follows this with a touch of earth and fresh flavors of green and yellow citrus. This is dry, bright and easy, and comes on very light feet. It's totally refreshing."
"The grounded, earthy roundness of oak is immediately apparent on the nose, adding floral notes of hay and fresh field mushroom. On the pliable palate, aromatic, pale apple notes play with a touch of citrus and evocative hayflower notes. The body is light, with crisp freshness and a little midpalate texture. It finishes clean and bright."
"This orange-tinted, medium-pink ros is a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Grenache Blanc. It's medium in weight, with understated cherry-berry fruit balanced by the suggestion of wet stone. Drink now."
"A restrained nose softly hints at tart berry and citrus. The palate is fresh but less precise when it comes to fruit: the body is light, dry and fresh, with a lasting note of citrus zestiness. With a clean finish and a tiny hint of grip, it's a wonderful ros for the table."
"From a range of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this accessible red is earthy and thick, the flavors dark and rich in coffee and tobacco. Gritty texture supports a big-boned embrace of blackberry and boysenberry, finishing in chocolate."
"Solid, rich and ripe red raspberries and brambly berries are upfront on the nose of this attractive wine, with seductive tones of sweet oak and cured meat in the back. Medium in weight, with spicy, structured tannins and ample acidity, the oak is well-integrated into the plush fruit core."
"It's relatively rare to see bottles from this appellation. High-toned aromas of herb, flower, dark plum and white pepper lead to ripe sweet plump cherry flavors. The structure is light but it delivers a lot of easy-drinking appeal."
"A deep color and effusive fruit aromas get this medium-bodied wine off to a big start, then vivid black cherry, blackberry and clove flavors kick in. It's focused on fresh fruit notes that go relatively deep on the palate and linger on the finish."
"A dark color and concentrated, raisin-like aromas lead to very ripe fruit flavors and a sense of sweetness in this medium-bodied wine. It's focused, bright and cherry-like on the palate, and the richness continues on the finish."
"An especially vivid coral color is matched by equally expressive peach, white raspberry and hazelnut flavors in this light-bodied and dry wine. A deft touch of fruit acidity matches the richness in texture for great balance."
"The aromas lean a bit into the green but not in an untoward way, with notes of parsley and other green herbs in front of pencil lead and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors bring a sense of restraint and polish that carries throughout the finish."
"Rose petal and lychee aromas highlight this semisweet, richly textured wine. Peach and maraschino cherry flavors tumble with the floral notes and spill over to the lingering finish."
"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, coffee, vanilla, smoke and blue and red berries lead to a palate full of plump fruit flavors with barrel accents throughout. It's a very pretty and elegant expression of the variety."
"This wine is made from two exceptionally cool coastal sites: Platt, a single-vineyard in its own right; and Martinelli Charles Ranch Vineyard. The wine follows suit, allowing for a concentrated take on golden apple and stony minerality, the nose crisp and focused in salty, floral notes."
"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022."
"You'll find aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, violet, tobacco and an earthy whiff of game on this. The aromas carry over to the full-bodied palate, together with hints of dark spice and dried cherry. Chewy tannins provide support."
"Moderate in structure, full bodied and ripe, this wine is tightly wound in firm, strong tannin. Light flavors of cherry and orange integrate spiky accents of clove, tea and dried herb."
"This blends 84% Merlot, 11% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot, the three varieties combining to full-bodied effect. Earthy in mushroom and cedar, its texture is leathery, with the palate dotted in tobacco and black pepper, the character savory and full of spice."
"Red apple and grapefruit zest are softly evoked on the nose. That same juicy combination plays on the light-bodied, dry palate. A zesty texture adds interest and crunch. The finish is clean and very refreshing."
"Vidal-Fleury ages its wines longer than most other Rhne firms, so don't be concerned that this is a year behind other Tavels on the market. It's the one ros appellation that can handle a bit of bottle age, so this is at its peak. It shows typical Tavel weight and richness, but also savory, almost meaty or mushroomy elements, balanced by bright citrus notes. Drink now."
"The aromas are bright, with notes of savory herb, orange peel, cranberry and spice. The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish. The tannins seem a little crunchy right now but should soften with some additional time in the bottle. It's a stylistically unique wine for the state. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best."
"Dark in color and meaty, this stainless-steel-fermented wine is made from Pinot Gris grapes from the Rocky Hill Vineyard and Pinot Noir grapes from Gold Rock Vineyard. Together, they offer a crisp interpretation of strawberry, watermelon and peach, finishing light and bright."
"This still has a touch of flinty reduction. Clean and fresh, the palate does not yet show much fruit. This seems stony and tight, with occasional glimpses of spice. The wine needs some air to open up but presents taut, clean refreshment."
"A blend of three vineyards, located between Corralitos and the Summit area, this bottling conveys rusty, earthy cranberries, cherries and Earl Grey tea on the nose. The earthy character also shows on the sip, where animal hide, sour cranberry, red plum, rose petal and pine-forest flavors converge."
"Ripe red and luscious black cherry are the fruity protagonists here, dominating nose and palate with their dense, aromatic ripeness. The fruit shimmers both red and black, backed by densely woven but fine tannins and countered by freshness and verve. Juiciness and fruit prevail."
"This unusual ros is a blend of both white and red grapes fermented together in oak barrels, but there's a nary a hint of toast or vanilla to suggest time in oak. It's an exceptionally well-integrated wine with fine finessed berry and watermelon flavors along with delicate hints of spice and cherry blossom. Zesty acidity and a fresh saline finish lend to its refreshing appeal."
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this vibrant sparkler offers heady aromas of mature stone fruit, pastry and citrus. The savory linear palate offers ripe yellow apple, white peach and chopped herb alongside bright acidity and a vivacious but refined perlage. A blast of citrus zest closes the finish."
"Great structure including firm tannins and supportive acidity gives this full-bodied wine a feeling of strength and longevity that should help it age. It has the classic red cherry, black cherry and mint flavors, with polished tannins for texture and a lingering finish. Best after 2022."
"This blend from the estate's Valley View and Lone Oak vineyards carries much of that savory, bone-dry character common in the region's Bordeaux-style bottlings. Leathery black plum and prune meet with black pepper, herbs and bittersweet chocolate on the nose. The dark fruit is layered on the palate and topped with oregano, dill, thyme and pepper dust."
"Ros from the Rocks District is a rarity. This one is a blend of 68% Grenache and 32% Mourvdre. Almost bronze in color, the aromas bring notes of strawberry, mineral, herb and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled flavors that bring appeal, stretching out on the finish."
"Layered, complex and mouthfilling, this full-bodied wine combines cedar, cinnamon and toasted-oak nuances with black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors. It feels firm and tannic, but the tannins seem to melt in the mouth and bring a balanced feel to the palate and finish."
"A year older than the other ross tasted for this report, this is mossy and developed, yet retains a hint of red berries. It's earthy, chocolaty and rich, with along, lingering, savory finish. Drink up."
"Made in the traditional method for sparkling wine production, this dry, refreshing wine is easy to enjoy on its own, with light fare or on a picnic. A light expression of wild strawberry and lemon peel, it's balanced in acidity and approach."
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this bright sparkler delivers wild raspberry, cherry and cake-spice sensations along with a hint of baked bread. Fresh acidity lifts the finish."
"Aromas of tobacco, wood grain, plum and cherry set up a plucky, lively palate with hard tannins. Spicy plum and berry flavors finish steady and drawing. Drunk now through 2023."
"The restrained nose just gives a glimpse of lemon freshness. Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine. The finish is dry and refreshing."
"Tight and focused, this opens with aromas of wild berry, red rose, culinary spice and a whisper of menthol. Chiseled and austere, the palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a hint of anise. Youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 20232033."
"This aerated, yellow-tinted brut nature smells mature, bready and buttery. The palate is full bodied, yeasty and anything but sweet. Salted citrus and papaya flavors are nutty and hold steady on a slightly flat finish. Drink now."
"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish."
"Rose petal, underbrush, grilled herb and game aromas take shape in the glass along with a balsamic note. On the firm full-bodied palate, hints of baking spice accent ripe (almost overripe) morello cherry and raspberry. Close-grained tannins give it an assertive finish. It's already almost accessible. Drink 20212028."
"Made as an ice wine, this sweet treat smells nutty, honeyed and a touch earthy It tastes rich, like salted peanuts coated with toffee and apricot syrup. The texture is viscous, palate-clinging and persistent, holding unctuous flavors for a long finish."
"Aromas of red berry, blue flower and tilled soil lead the way on this young elegant wine. The fresh tightly wound palate shows cherry, licorice, sage and an iron note set against close-knit tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to come around. Drink 20202031."
Winemaker Ed Kurtzman manages to bring restraint to this often very ripe region. This bottling shows subtle white-flower buds and the slightest hints of coconut cream on the nose. Delicate flavors of honeysuckle and Key lime are subtle and will intensify with time.
"Juicy fresh raspberry and cranberry flavors juxtapose savory tones of bramble, smoke and earth in this elegant Cabernet Franc. Concentrated red fruit and supple texture suggest a fresh easygoing nature invigorated by bright zesty streaks of acidity. It drinks easily already but should hold well through 2021."
"Champoux, Charbonneau, Ciel du Cheval, Elephant Mountain, Klipsun, and Slide Mountain vineyards make up this wine. The aromas are lightly styled, with notes of baking spice, caramel, licorice, raspberry and dried herb. It comes off as full bodied, rich and liquorous, coating the palate from end to end with ripe red and black-fruit flavors. It's a hedonistic delight."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Oasis (84%) and Olsen vineyards. A pale golden color, the aromas are light, with notes of lees, stone fruit, cinnamon, cream and spice. The palate is creamy and full in feel, with pleasing spice accents on the extended finish. A touch of warmth is the only thing that holds it back."
"This wine is a blend of fruit from the Bacchus (57%), Dionysus (22%) and Olsen (21%) vineyards. The aromas are vibrant, with notes of lime zest, white peach, apple and mineral, along with whiffs of reduction. It drinks dry, with a sleek high-acid styling. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best."
"Pretty pink in color, this wine is inviting in aromatics, offering a depth of fresh strawberry and watermelon atop a substantial mouthfeel of body and weight. It finishes balanced and dry."
"This is a luscious boldly extracted Cabernet Sauvignon full of fleshy ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's also a nuanced wine, shaded by wisps of smoke and bramble, and calibrated with zesty mouthwatering acidity. The finish is marked by lingering spice and ripe rigid tannins."
"Medium in build and lengthy with layers of flavor, this vineyard-designate offers a wealth of rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry and black tea, the background built around strong notions of forest floor."
"Medium bodied and silky in texture, this is an unusually graceful and elegant Chteauneuf-du-Pape. Baked cherries and raspberries on the nose give way to a mix of red and black fruits on the palate, then finish fine, dry and savory. Drink now2021."
"If you are of the school that says ros from Provence is the world's gold standard, then give this excellent newcomer a try. Brief skin contact has created a light color and sense of elegance on the nose and palate. Flavors of cantaloupe and peach are lightly sweet but cut by ample acidity. Drink as soon as possible to capture this wine's fresh essence."
"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing."
"A salty hint of yeast and fresh, green apple and pear appear on the nose. The slender palate is enlivened by lemon brightness and slight spritz. Cheeky green fruit and white pepper tingle everywhere, making for an easy but refreshing drink."
"This wine is a blend of grapes seldom found in the state: Souzo (34%) Tinta Roriz (33%), Touriga Nacional (31%) and Tinta Co. The aromas jump out of the glass, with notes of violets, purple fruit, freshly peeled orange, barrel spice and earth. The soft plush fruit flavors are extremely fresh and piquant, with the oak influence seeming dialed back. It's a very intriguing wine."
"There is a gamy streak in the red-cherry nose of this juicy wine. The light palate has that same animal touch on its lively, tart but ripe red-cherry center. Tannins are soft and finely, densely woven, brightened by ample freshness. This very appetizing red should be served very slightly chilled."
"Coming from 17-year-old vines, this is a one-of-a-kind wine in the state, seeing no new oak and released earlier than most whites. Light but alluring aromas of fresh herb, sage, flower and raspberry lead to ultra-pure red-fruit flavors. It's delightful on its own but put it on the dinner table to see it truly shine."
"Herbal in peppercorn and mountain sage, this light-bodied wine retains elegance, offering structure around vibrant flavors of raspberry and red currant."
"Fairly light aromas of fresh lemon, nectarine, scratched grapefruit skin and a little chalk show on the nose of this crisp bottling. The palate is all about tension and acid-driven freshness, with pear peels and lime rinds making for a slightly sour sip."
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%), Merlot (35%) and Cabernet Franc comes from Bacchus, Dionysus, Weinbau and Seven Hills vineyardssome of the top vineyards in the state. Dark roasted coffee bean, char, herb and cherry aromas lead to restrained fruit and barrel flavors that show a fine sense of elegance. It delivers a lot of quality and value."
"Fresh lemon flesh and an edge of white pepper play on the nose. The palate has the same spicy freshness; the body is slender, fresh, dry and light. Glimpses of spicy white pepper appear time and again amid ripe notions of yellow Mirabelle plum."
"A touch of green bell pepper and boxwood appears amidst the citrus scent on the nose. The palate majors on crisp lemon tartness, with some of those appetizing green boxwood and pepper flavors, too. The body is light, lean, dry and refreshing."
"Balance is at the heart of Eric and Sophie Meynaud's winemaking. Ripe and fruity, this is a perfumed wine that has a fine balance between the structure and the fruit. With its acidity and spice, it is going to develop into a delicious, juicy wine. Drink from 2018."
"The wine is rich, with firm young tannins as well as generous blackberry fruits. The dry core of the wine will certainly soften as this ripe wine matures. The blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in almost equal measure, gives the wine its balanced fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020."
"Ripe and juicy, this is a generous wine from Jean-Pierre Soubie. It has fine tannins that are already well integrated into the perfumed red-berry fruits. This is going to be a delicious, while always crisp, wine. Drink from 2018."
"Close to 100% Merlot, this wine comes from the old vines of this small Pomerol estate. It is rich, still with its tannins intact, and offers a solid burst of ripe black fruits. The wine is still young, still with the first flush of fruitiness. Drink from 2020."
"Front-loaded aromas of oak and vanilla lead tobacco, plum and berry scents on this classic-style Rioja reserva that's perky and grabby on the palate. Vanilla, cocoa and woodspice flavors are as prominent as those of cherry and plum, while mocha is the key flavor on a long, oaky finish. Drink this high-energy Rioja through 2025."
"Sweet-seeming aromas of baked blackberries, lilacs, fresh fennel and hot pastry show on the nose of this bottling from deep up the Carmel Valley. The palate dries up impressively, retaining the blackberry-pie touch while a strong acidity delivers flavors of cocoa dust and cola. Layered tannins keep it all together."
"The 30% Cabernet Franc in the blend makes all the difference to this rich perfumed wine. It has tannins and plenty of spicy flavors from wood fermentation and aging. The secret, though, is that it also has rich layered blackberries and the acidity to give the wine a lift. Drink from 2020."

"It's exciting to see what can be done with Pinot Noir in Paso, a region typically considered too warm for the grape.

"Cabernet clones 6, 8 and 191 make up the majority of this wine. The aromas show some reduction out of the gate. This is followed by a medium-bodied, acid driven palate, with clove, cherry, wood spice and herb flavors. There's intrigue but it doesn't all quite come together. That said, it should fit in well at the dinner table."

It's hard not to like this dark-colored and superripe wine made from 60% Alicante Bouschet plus Mourvdre and Petite Sirah.

"It's still very early in the life of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 15% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, so it's likely that it will improve with time.

Baked black cherry, black-plum pie, vanilla crust and anise show on the nose. The palate offers plum juice and rose petals, proving a bit thick but entirely pleasant."
"Petit Verdot makes up a full 14% of this wine, which also includes 9% Cabernet Franc. Penetrating aromas of raspberries, fresh cherries, licorice, herb, vanilla and barrel spices are at the fore.

"Produced from 90% Merlot and 10% Malbec, this wine is made by two young brothers. It is ripe and structured, still young of course, but with delicious ripely fruity potential. Black-currant and berry flavors are lifted by acidity and held firmly by the structure. Drink from 2019."

Supple tannins give it a smooth texture. Enjoy soon."

Toasty oak is a big player, creating creamy aromas and toast on the finish. In between are crisp, peppery blackberry flavors. This wine may improve with time. Drink 20182028."
"Aromas of smoke, vanilla, pencil box and green herb are followed by red fruit and medicinal flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish."

There is a slightly burnt butter character to the sip, where touches of sweet corn and vanilla meet with citrus tang. Altogether, it's a very light expression of the region."

It is a structured and ripe wine, showing the fruit of the vintage while also keeping solid tannins. Drink from 2019."
"Vines situated close to the fortified citadel of Blaye have produced this bright and shiny 2014. With its clear red-berry fruits, black currants and acidity, it is immediately attractive. The tannins, a great support to the fruit, promise some aging. Drink now, or, better yet, wait until 2018."

It's intriguing and unique, though not particularly pink."

"This is a very dry and dusty wine. That experience starts on the nose, where dried oregano, pencil shavings and bittersweet-chocolate aromas meet with restrained blackberry juice. The herbal wave carries into the sip, with marjoram, bay leaf and dill playing into slightly sour black-plum fruit."
"A black color with a gold rim and thick legs greasing up the glass are telling, meaning this is a heavyweight. Aromas are oddly floral, like violets mixed with pencil eraser. This is well into the syrupy realm, with flavors of Mexican spiced chocolate. A slightly off mix of caramel and peppery flavors closes this out."
